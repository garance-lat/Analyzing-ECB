But the nature of the inflation challenge in the euro area is changing. We are seeing a decline in the inflation rate as the shocks that originally drove up inflation wane and our monetary policy actions are transmitted to the economy. But the pass-through of those shocks is still ongoing, making the decline in inflation slower and the inflation process more persistent. This persistence is caused by the fact that inflation is working its way through the economy in phases, as different economic agents try to pass the costs on to each other. And while it has been anticipated for some time in our staff projections, we have revised our assessment as new data have come in. Monetary policymakers need to address this dynamic decisively to ensure that it does not lead to a self-fulfilling spiral fed by a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. So, the key question we face today is: how can we break this persistence? In the ECB’s Governing Council, we have been clear that two elements of our policy stance will be key: we will have to bring rates to “sufficiently restrictive” levels and keep them there “for as long as necessary”. Both elements are affected by uncertainty about the persistence of inflation and about the strength of the transmission of monetary policy to inflation. Setting the right “level” and “length” will be critical for our monetary policy as we continue our tightening cycle. In my remarks today, I will explore why the inflation process has become more persistent and what this implies for our policy stance. My intention is not to signal any future decisions, but rather to frame the issues that monetary policy will face in the period ahead. The inflation shock The euro area economy has faced a series of overlapping inflationary shocks since the end of the pandemic.[1] Since the beginning of 2022, these shocks have both raised the price level by 11% and led to us transferring more than €200 billion to the rest of the world in the form of a terms of trade tax.[2] In an environment such as this, the natural reaction of every economic agent is to try to pass on these price increases to other actors in the economy. In the euro area, we can identify two distinct phases in this process. The first phase was led by firms, which reacted to steeply rising input costs by defending their margins and passing on the cost increases to consumers. The intensity of this reaction was unusual. During previous terms-of-trade shocks in the euro area, firms had tended to absorb rising costs in profit margins, as slower growth made consumers less willing to tolerate price hikes.[3] But the special conditions we experienced last year turned this regularity on its head. The sheer scale of input cost growth made it harder for consumers to judge whether price hikes were caused by higher costs or higher profits, fuelling a faster and stronger pass-through. At the same time, pent-up demand in reopening sectors, excess savings, expansionary policies and supply restrictions brought on by bottlenecks gave firms more scope to test consumer demand with higher prices. For this reason, unit profits contributed around two-thirds to domestic inflation[4] in 2022, whereas in the previous 20 years their average contribution had been around one-third.[5] This in turn led to the shocks feeding into inflation much more quickly and forcefully than in the past. This first phase is however now starting to wane. Largely thanks to lower energy prices, year-on-year producer price inflation has already dropped by 42 percentage points from its peak last summer. And while this is taking time to feed through to prices more generally, it is partly being reflected in a broad-based decline in headline inflation and a levelling off in some measures of underlying inflation – especially exclusion-based measures and those that capture the persistent effects of energy on economy-wide prices. At the same time, high inflation has eaten into domestic demand, which contracted by 2% over the last two quarters[6], and the consumption impulse created by excess savings is fading.[7] The early effects of our policy tightening are also becoming visible, especially in sectors like manufacturing and construction that are more sensitive to interest rate changes. Faced with this combination – falling input costs and dwindling demand – we saw unit profit growth slow markedly in most sectors in the first quarter of this year. A more persistent inflation process But the second phase of the inflation process is now starting to become stronger. Workers have so far lost out from the inflation shock, seeing large real wage declines, which is triggering a sustained wage “catch-up” process as they try to recover their losses. This is pushing up other measures of underlying inflation that capture more domestic price pressures – particularly measures of wage-sensitive inflation and domestic inflation. And since wage bargaining in many European countries is multi-annual and inertial, this process will naturally play out over several years. In our latest projections, we expect wages to grow by a further 14% between now and the end of 2025 and to fully recover their pre-pandemic level in real terms. While this “catch up” has long been factored into our inflation outlook, the effect on inflation from rising wages has recently been amplified by lower productivity growth than we had previously projected, which is leading to higher unit labour costs. Alongside past upward surprises, this is a key reason why we recently revised up our projections for core inflation, even though our expectations for wages remained broadly the same. Two features of the current business cycle are contributing to this dynamic – and both could linger, too. The first is the resilience of employment relative to GDP growth. Typically, we would have expected slowing economic growth over the last year to have somewhat reduced employment growth. But for the last three quarters in particular, the labour market has been performing better than an “Okun’s law”-based regularity would suggest. That disconnect partly reflects increased labour hoarding by firms in a context of labour shortages, which is visible in the current gap between total hours worked and average hours worked.[8] This is weighing on productivity growth and, with unemployment expected to fall slightly further over the projection horizon, the motivation for firms to hoard labour may not disappear quickly. The second feature contributing to weaker aggregate productivity is the composition of employment growth, which is concentrated in sectors with structurally low productivity growth. Since the pandemic, employment has grown most in construction and the public sector, both of which have seen a decline in productivity, and in services, which has seen only meagre productivity growth. These trends could also persist in some of these sectors over the next few years given the relative weakness of manufacturing and long-term shifts towards employment in services. All this means that we will face several years of rising nominal wages, with unit labour cost pressures exacerbated by subdued productivity growth. And in this setting, monetary policy must achieve two key goals. First, we must ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored as the wage catch-up process plays out. While we do not currently see a wage-price spiral or a de-anchoring of expectations, the longer inflation remains above target, the greater such risks become. That means we need to bring inflation back to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. Second, for this to happen, we need to ensure that firms absorb rising labour costs in margins. If monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive, the economy can achieve disinflation overall while real wages recover some of their losses. But this hinges on our policy dampening demand for some time so that firms cannot continue to display the pricing behaviour we have recently seen. Sensitivity analysis by ECB staff underlines the risks we would face if firms tried to defend their margins instead. For instance, if firms were to regain 25% of the lost profit margin that our projections foresee, inflation in 2025 would be substantially higher than the baseline – at almost 3%. So, faced with a more persistent inflation process, we need a more persistent policy – one that not only produces sufficient tightening today, but also maintains restrictive conditions until we can be confident that this second phase of the inflation process has been resolved. The policy stance What does this imply for our policy in concrete terms? We have not yet seen the full impact of the cumulative rate hikes we have decided on since last July – amounting to 400 basis points. But our job is not done. Barring a material change to the outlook, we will continue to increase rates in July. And as we move further into restrictive territory, we need to pay close attention to two dimensions of our policy. First, our actions on the “level” of rates, and second, our communication on future decisions and how that is influencing the expected “length” of time that rates will remain at that level. The Governing Council has provided orientation on both dimensions. It has stated clearly that “future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary”. Two sources of uncertainty affect the desired “level” and “length” of our interest rate policies. First, since we face uncertainty about the persistence of inflation, the level at which rates peak will be state-contingent. It will depend on how the economy and various forces I have described evolve over time. And it will have to be continuously re-assessed over time. Under these conditions, it is unlikely that in the near future the central bank will be able to state with full confidence that the peak rates have been reached. This is why our policy needs to be decided meeting by meeting and has to remain data-dependent. Second, we face uncertainty about the strength of monetary policy transmission. The strength of transmission connects current decisions with expectations of future policy and therefore affects the policy stance. How strong transmission turns out to be in practice will determine the effect of a given rate hike on inflation, and this will be reflected in the expected policy path. Uncertainty about transmission arises from the fact that the euro area has not been through a sustained phase of rate hikes since the mid-2000s and has never seen rates rise so quickly. And this raises the question of how quickly and forcefully monetary policy will be transmitted to firms – via interest-sensitive spending – and households, via mortgage payments. For firms, ECB analysis finds that monetary policy shocks are typically transmitted more quickly and forcefully to manufacturing, reflecting the sector’s higher interest-rate sensitivity, while there is a more muted and delayed impact on services. The key question today is whether the services sector will eventually “catch down” – which is what we have seen in previous cycles – or whether it will be insulated from the effects of policy tightening for longer than in the past, given the strength of demand and employment in the sector.[9] For households, there is evidence that it will take longer for policy changes to pass through to interest burdens in this tightening cycle, as a higher share of households have fixed-rate mortgages than in the mid-2000s. At the same time, once mortgages have been repriced, the restrictive effect may be greater: gross debt-to-income ratios, which emphasise debt servicing capacity, are higher than in previous tightening cycles, while the share of homeowners with a mortgage has increased.[10] Both sources of uncertainty will only fade away with time. And that is why we have made our future policy decisions conditional on, first, the inflation outlook, second, the dynamics of underlying inflation and third, the strength of policy transmission. But to ensure that uncertainty does not interfere with our intended policy stance – in terms of both “level” and “length” – two points are clear. First, we need to bring rates into “sufficiently restrictive” territory to lock in our policy tightening. Second, we need to communicate clearly that we will stay “at those levels for as long as necessary”. This will ensure that hiking rates does not elicit expectations of a too-rapid policy reversal and will allow the full impact of our past actions to materialise. And all the while, we need to carefully evaluate the strength of policy transmission in order to avoid an error in calibrating policy in either direction. Conclusion Let me conclude. Monetary policy currently has only one goal: to return inflation to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. And we are committed to reaching this goal come what may. As the author Helen Keller wrote, “our worst foes are not belligerent circumstances, but wavering spirits”.[11] We have made significant progress but – faced with a more persistent inflation process – we cannot waver, and we cannot declare victory yet. For more detail on these shocks, see Lagarde, C. (2022), “Monetary policy in a high inflation environment: commitment and clarity”, lecture organised by Eesti Pank and dedicated to Professor Ragnar Nurkse, Tallinn, 4 November. Cumulatively, from the second quarter of 2022 up to the latest data point available (the first quarter of 2023), the euro area has transferred €213 billion to the rest of the world as a result of the terms of trade losses. This figure corresponds to 1.6% of euro area GDP. Arce, O., Hahn, E. and Koester, G. (2023), “How tit-for-tat inflation can make everyone poorer”, The ECB Blog, 30 March.

These are core national values in Lithuania – and accordingly, they are engraved in the edge-lettering on Lithuania’s €2 coin. Freedom, because of the liberation from Soviet occupation. Unity, because of the need for national solidarity. And well-being, expressing hope for economic and social prosperity. These three words capture the spirit of the Lithuanian people. And I believe that being part of the euro has strengthened each of them. The country is now an equal partner in setting monetary policy by one of the world’s most important central banks in the third largest economy, the euro area. That gives Lithuania freedom in charting its own macroeconomic destiny that smaller economies cannot typically claim, who often have to import the monetary policy of their larger neighbours. Lithuania now also issues the world’s second most important reserve and invoicing currency. That provides unity in the face of a more volatile world, as foreign shocks do not penetrate the domestic economy as much, owing to domestic currency invoicing. Lithuania is especially resilient on this front, invoicing 78% of its exports to non-member countries in euros last year, the fourth highest share across the EU. And being part of the euro has increased the well-being of the Lithuanian people. When Lithuania joined the euro area in 2015, GDP per capita in purchasing power standard terms was around 70% of the euro area average. By 2023, it exceeded 83%. But more recently, the country has dealt with very high inflation, peaking at 22.5% in September 2022 – more than double the peak seen in the euro area as a whole. This high-inflation episode has led to a pronounced monetary policy cycle, with the ECB raising rates by 450 basis points, holding them steady for 9 months, and then cutting rates by 100 basis points since June as we entered the “dialling back” phase of our policy. However, even in this “dialling back” phase, until recently we retained a restrictive bias in our future policy orientation. At our last meeting, we dropped that bias. Today, I would like to explain what motivated this change and what it implies for the future. In a nutshell, we have seen the environment change in three important ways that increase our confidence that inflation is returning to our target. These changes concern the path of inflation, the shocks driving inflation and the risks to inflation. The path of inflation The first important change relates to the path of inflation. In the earlier part of our monetary policy cycle, the path of inflation was characterised by high uncertainty. We consistently saw the return of inflation to target in our projections being pushed back. At the same time, the incoming inflation data were surprising on the upside, casting further doubt on the accuracy of those projections. ECB staff models using machine learning[1] indicate that in 2022 and 2023 uncertainty around inflation forecasts was around four to five times higher than in the long-term average. This uncertainty about the inflation path had implications for the policy horizon – that is, the period within which we want to see inflation converging to our target. Normally, the medium-term policy horizon is flexible and can be extended depending on the nature, size and persistence of the shocks. But if there is a risk of inflation expectations becoming de-anchored, the horizon must be shortened to the nearest possible date that monetary policy can take effect to prevent that risk materialising – which given normal transmission lags is around two years. With inflation rising and its return to target continually being pushed back, at a certain point we considered that the risk of de-anchoring had become too high. So, in September 2022 we introduced the notion that the return of inflation to our target had to be “timely”. Our aim was to fix the policy horizon and thereby build confidence among the public that there would be no more delays. Now, after a lengthy period of restrictive policy, our confidence that we are seeing a “timely” return to target has increased. Since September last year, we have had six consecutive forecast rounds showing inflation returning to target in the course of 2025. And this arrival date has stayed constant even as we have drawn closer to it. The uncertainty around these projections has decreased significantly. Our machine learning models now put the uncertainty bands at close to pre-pandemic levels. The incoming data have, over time, validated the path laid out in the forecasts. Since early 2023, the accuracy of staff projections has returned to the levels seen pre-COVID, especially for headline inflation. While errors for core inflation have taken longer to normalise, this year they have also returned to historical standards. And this confidence is confirmed in inflation expectations. Among households, median expectations for inflation three years ahead are close to 2%, and market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have also fallen in recent months. The shocks driving inflation The second change in the environment relates to the shocks driving inflation. The major challenge for monetary policy during this cycle is that we have faced a sequence of very large shocks which – given staggered wage- and price-setting in the euro area – have transmitted through the economy in persistent and hard-to-forecast ways. So, even as our confidence in our projections increased, we had to be careful in making our policy stance less restrictive too quickly. We needed a policy framework that would allow us to better understand this complex inflation process. That is why we built our reaction function around our well-known three criteria: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission. Focusing on the dynamics of underlying inflation allowed us to extract more robustly the trend in inflation based on the data we could see in front of us, complementing the information provided by our forecasts. And for a given inflation path, assessing the strength of monetary transmission allowed us to judge whether our tightening impulse was being passed on through the transmission chain and was thus effective in steering inflation back towards 2%. This forward-looking framework has provided a way of broadening our information set to capture the pace at which a very large past shock – 10.6% inflation at its peak – was running its course, and how our monetary policy stance was transmitting through the economy and affecting medium-term inflation. For some time, the signals from underlying inflation were still flagging the risk that inflation might not decline as quickly as indicated in our forecasts. But recently this risk has declined and there is now greater alignment between our forecasts and underlying inflation. The width of the range of measures of underlying inflation that we monitor has narrowed towards its historical average, with most indicators hovering between 2% and 2.8%, which we take as an indicator of receding uncertainty on future inflation dynamics. The Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI), which has the best predictive power for future inflation, has remained at around 2% since the end of last year. There is one measure that is still above this range, which is domestic inflation, capturing items with a low import content. But this is a year-on-year measures that is made up 97% of services items, and so it is still registering repricing events that took place earlier this year that are keeping services inflation around 4%. However, if we look at the PCCI for services, which strips out base effects, the measure currently stands at 2.5%. Inflation momentum for services has also dropped steeply recently. These data suggest that there is scope for a downward adjustment in services inflation, and thereby domestic inflation, in the coming months. Confirming this picture, wage growth – which is the main cost factor driving services – is on a downward trajectory and continues to be buffered by negative growth in unit profits, buffering the pass-through of rising wages to prices. The ECB wage tracker – which captures wage agreements in seven euro area countries representing around 85% of total wages in the euro area – sees wage growth slowing from 4.8% this year to around 3% in 2025, the level we generally consider to be consistent with our target. The risks to inflation The third change in the environment relates to the risks to inflation. The fact that past shocks were expected to travel slowly along the pricing chain meant that, in recent years, the risks to inflation were mostly to the upside. And despite the progress we have seen in underlying inflation, these risks have not disappeared entirely. The composition of inflation remains unbalanced, with the recent slowdown being driven mostly by energy inflation, which is particularly volatile, and industrial goods. The adjustment process for slower-moving services inflation is still unfinished. So, we will have to remain watchful until the downward adjustment in services inflation that we expect is confirmed by the data. However, as past shocks fade, the risks to the inflation outlook have changed. And crucially, these risks are now related more to potential future shocks than to the transmission of past ones. The main downside risks relate to the weaker-than-expected growth outlook and the increased uncertainty surrounding growth triggered by geopolitical events. For some time now, we have been seeing small sequential downward revisions to the growth outlook which have cumulatively amounted to a quite significant downgrade over time. For example, if we go back to our June 2023 projections, we expected average growth of 1.5% in 2024. Now, we expect 0.7%. One driver of this delayed recovery has been sluggish export growth, driven by the competitive challenges facing euro area companies. But the most important driver of our growth forecast misses has been the domestic economy. In fact, around half of the misses since end-2021 relate to investment and a quarter relate to consumption. The behaviour of investment can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the stronger-than-expected impact of higher interest rates, higher energy prices and structural deterrents. The inertia in consumption has been striking given that the conditions for a recovery are in place. Employment is historically high and real incomes are rising. But households continue to save an unusually high share of their income and take a cautious approach to spending. One reason for this caution is that many households have a perception of their real income growth that is well below measured data. Just 37% of households in our consumer survey believe that their real income has risen or stayed the same, even though 50% of all households have experienced actual increases. And these households have significantly lower consumption growth than those with correct perceptions. This pessimism about real incomes is largely driven by past inflation, and so in principle it should dissipate as the high-inflation episode moves further into the rearview mirror.[2] But increasing geopolitical uncertainty could create new dents in household sentiment. In particular, if the United States – our largest export market – takes a protectionist turn, growth in the euro area is likely to take a hit. Our exporters also specialise in capital goods that other countries use for export production, which makes them particularly sensitive to shifts in confidence about world trade. The main upside risks we see in the future also relate to external shocks. A rise in geopolitical tensions could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term, while extreme weather events could drive up food prices. The net effect of trade fragmentation and tariffs on inflation remains uncertain, as it involves assumptions that are impossible to anticipate with precision. These include potential retaliatory actions as well as exchange rate and commodity price movements. Implications for monetary policy So what does this changing environment mean for our monetary policy? There are three main implications. The first concerns our current policy stance and its future orientation. The current policy stance is restrictive. But if the incoming data continue to confirm our baseline, the direction of travel is clear and we expect to lower interest rates further. In terms of the future orientation, we previously said that “we will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary”. This bias was necessary in an environment of high realised inflation and high uncertainty about future inflation. But it no longer reflects the evolving macroeconomic landscape, our outlook for inflation or the balance of risks around it. With the disinflation process well on track, and downside risks to growth, this bias in our communication is no longer warranted. These considerations are reflected in the monetary policy statement adopted by the Governing Council last week. We no longer aim for “sufficiently restrictive” policy, but rather intend to deliver an “appropriate” policy stance. The second implication for monetary policy concerns our reaction function. The high-inflation period has proven the value of the three criteria we have been using to take decisions, which is why the Governing Council confirmed this policy framework at last week’s meeting. And these criteria will be invaluable in the period ahead, even as the risks to inflation move from past shocks to future ones. In an uncertain environment, we will need to continue complementing our baseline outlook with a rich distribution of possible risks derived from current data. But our framework is flexible, in the sense that we can change the weight we put on the different legs of our reaction function depending on the nature of the shocks we are facing. For example, if we face large geopolitical shocks that significantly increase uncertainty about the inflation projections, we will need to draw on other sources of data to make the risk assessment surrounding our baseline outlook more robust. At the same time, the purpose of monitoring underlying inflation is to help us differentiate noise in the inflation data from underlying trends. So, if underlying trends are not affected, it will help increase confidence in the baseline projection. And assessing monetary transmission will continue to be important, as geopolitical uncertainty may affect monetary transmission by altering the risk appetite of investors, borrowers and financial intermediaries. The third implication concerns the policy horizon. Even though we are not there yet, we are close to achieving our target. So, we are no longer in a situation where we need to fix the policy horizon at the shortest possible transmission lag. We can return to a situation where the policy horizon can adjust depending on the nature, size and persistence of the shocks as needed. This change explains why we have removed the notion of “timeliness” from our monetary policy statement, focusing instead on achieving “sustainable” inflation convergence. And it puts us in the best position to react to future shocks. Conclusion Let me conclude. The Lithuanian poem “The Seasons” (Metai), written by Kristijonas Donelaitis, charts the cyclical nature of the rural life of Lithuanians. The ECB is also moving through its monetary policy cycle, and we are now at a stage where the darkest days of winter look to be behind us, and we can start to look forward instead. We certainly hope that the days ahead will be better. But winds are blowing in different directions and there is much uncertainty before us. So, our monetary policy will be prepared for all scenarios to come.

Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Trinity College Dublin Dublin, 6 March 2023 Introduction When inflation has been far from target for a sustained period and the process of monetary tightening has been under way for some time, there are three primary inputs into monetary policy decisions.[1] First, in view of the medium-term orientation of monetary policy, the inflation forecast over the next one to three years plays an important role. Second, the incoming information on underlying inflation constitutes an essential additional basis for assessing medium-term inflation dynamics, in view of the conditional nature, the lower frequency of production and the intrinsic uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic forecasts.[2] Third, especially in view of the transmission lags from shifts in the monetary policy stance to the financial system, the economy and inflation dynamics, assessing the incoming information on the transmission of previous monetary policy decisions is also necessary for the appropriate calibration of monetary policy decisions.[3] My focus today is on the second input: underlying inflation. The assessment of underlying inflation (which should be understood in a broad sense, including the information contained in wage dynamics and inflation expectations) should be viewed as a complementary cross-check to the inflation forecasting process. In one direction, if the signals from underlying inflation at a given point in time support the narrative embedded in the inflation forecast, this boosts confidence levels (among policymakers, market participants, firms and households) in the inflation forecasts. In the other direction, if the signals from underlying inflation at a given point in time are at odds with the inflation forecast, this calls for robust policy decisions that take into account the different signals coming from the forecast and the analysis of underlying inflation.[4] My plan for this lecture is as follows. First, I will discuss the conceptual issues involved in analysing underlying inflation. Second, I will review the recent data flows that are relevant for assessing underlying inflation in the euro area. Third, I will offer some concluding remarks on the role of underlying inflation in the setting of monetary policy over the coming months. Underlying inflation: conceptual issues Ehrmann et al. (2018) summarise the basis for examining measures of underlying inflation as follows: “The central bank faces the problem of distinguishing in real time the “signal” on medium-term inflationary pressure contained in the HICP inflation data from the “noise” stemming from temporary or idiosyncratic factors. To this end, measures of underlying inflation are routinely monitored. Generally, their purpose is to obtain an estimate of where headline inflation will settle in the medium term after temporary factors have vanished.” [5] In view of the major dislocations of recent years (the pandemic, the energy shock, the war), it is helpful to think of headline inflation as currently being driven by three factors: (a) pure noise; (b) a reverting component; and (c) underlying inflation. In particular, the economics of dislocations suggest that there is currently a substantial reverting component of inflation that is sufficiently long-lasting not to constitute pure noise but that can also be expected to fade out over the near term. Examples of the reverting component include: the passthrough of energy and food cost shocks to other sectors; the impact of bottlenecks; and pandemic re-opening effects by which there are temporary mismatches between demand and supply in contact-intensive sectors. These factors contributed to the sharp rise in inflation since the middle of 2021 and, even if there has been some easing or even a reversal in these factors, the adjustment process to these shocks is still ongoing and is not likely to come to a sudden stop. While the adjustment process may also affect medium-term inflation dynamics, the quantitative contribution to inflation is plausibly larger over the near term than over the medium term. Since the peak impact of monetary policy is further out than one year, this reverting component of inflation should be less important for monetary policy than the medium-term underlying component. Since the standard measures of underlying inflation typically make a two-level distinction between the transitory and persistent components of inflation, these standard measures should not be taken at face value under conditions in which the slowly-reverting component might be (at least partly) mis-classified as contributing to medium-term inflation dynamics. It follows that the interpretation of the standard measures require additional analysis under current conditions to take into account the potential role of the reverting component. Before turning to the analysis of the range of indicators of underlying inflation, it is also necessary to recognise that the trajectory of the underlying inflation component can be affected by shocks to the noise and reverting components of inflation. First, even a pure noise shock can have a permanent effect on the price level if a positive inflation shock is not followed by a subsequent negative inflation shock. This holds even more strongly for a shock to the reverting component: since a sustained period of high inflation can leave a large footprint on the price level if it is not fully reversed. In turn, a surprise permanent increase in the price level can trigger medium-term inflation dynamics through its impact on the subsequent path for nominal wages, as some unwinding of the initial decline in real wages can be expected and the wage adjustment process can play out over an extended period.[6] Second, especially if there is a backwards-looking component in how firms, households and financial market participants form beliefs, a period of high inflation can persistently alter inflation expectations, with a direct and substantial impact on medium-term inflation expectations. Again, this risk is more substantial in relation to the reverting component than the pure noise component of inflation. For these reasons, actual inflation outcomes and measures of inflation expectations belong in the family of indicators that are relevant in assessing the underlying inflation pressures. In one direction, strong increases in headline inflation or an upward above-target revision in inflation expectations would reinforce upward pressure on underlying inflation; in the other direction, a material decline in headline inflation or an easing in above-target inflation expectations should alleviate upward pressure on underlying inflation. Underlying Inflation: indicators and analytics Inflation increased very quickly since the middle of 2021 (Chart 1). While the peak was at 10.6 per cent in October, inflation has remained at a high level, with the February reading still at 8.5 per cent. Comparing headline inflation to the various standard indicators of underlying inflation, Chart 1 also shows that the decline in inflation has been primarily due to the easing of some temporary inflation pressures, most notably the remarkable decline in gas prices in recent months.[7] Chart 1 also shows that various forecasts (including the December 2022 Eurosystem staff projections) project a substantial decline in inflation later in 2023 that extends into 2024 and 2025. The gap between standard measures of underlying inflation and these forecasts poses significant interpretative challenges for policymakers. Chart 1 Indicators of underlying inflation and inflation projections and expectations (annual percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.The latest observations are for February 2023 (flash) for HICP and HICPX and January 2023 for the rest of underlying inflation measures. The latest observations for market-based indicators of inflation compensation are for 2 March 2023. The SPF data show expected annual percentage changes one-year and two-years ahead of latest available (i.e. Dec 2022) HICP data available at the time the Q1 2023 round was conducted (i.e. for Dec 2023 and Dec 2024) and for the calendar year 2025. The Survey of Monetary Analysts and the December 2022 Broad Macroeconomic Projection exercise (BMPE) by Eurosystem staff show quarterly forecasts. The cut-off date for data included in the ECB staff macroeconomic projections was 30 November. As shown in Chart 1, the ECB tracks several indicators of underlying inflation. Each indicator has its advantages and disadvantages: monitoring a range of indicators helps to guard from any specific approach being affected by idiosyncratic factors and model uncertainty.[8] The most prominent standard indicator of underlying inflation is core inflation defined as the HICP excluding energy and food (HICPX), which stands at 5.6 per cent in the February data. The latest available (January) estimates show that the other underlying inflation indicators range between 4.1 per cent (Persistent and Common Component of Inflation - PCCI - excluding energy) and 8.1 per cent (the 10 per cent trimmed mean). While the PCCI measures have eased in recent months, most other indicators do not show signs of a turnaround.[9] In overall terms, the range is not only elevated but also wide, indicating that there is a high level of uncertainty about underlying inflation. In trying to gain further understanding about underlying inflation dynamics, it is worthwhile to examine momentum in inflation dynamics. While the typical focus is on an annual frequency (the price level today compared to the price level one year ago), this necessarily implies some inertia in inflation measurement, given the high overlap on a month-to-month basis in annual inflation calculations. At the same time, switching focus to a much higher frequency (such as month-to-month inflation data) runs the risk of increasing the noise-to-signal ratio in view of the role of seasonal and idiosyncratic factors in the monthly data. An intermediate option is to examine as momentum indicators the 3 month on 3 month seasonally-adjusted inflation data (annualised for comparability purposes). Chart 2 shows the momentum indicators for the main HICP categories.[10] While there has been a clear turnaround in energy inflation and there are some signs of deceleration for food inflation, momentum for core inflation has not declined. In particular, momentum in the goods category remains strong. The momentum indicator for services inflation requires a nuanced interpretation. The basic series suggests an easing of services inflation since November. An alternative series (the dashed line) that excludes the impact of the cheap travel ticket scheme in Germany last summer indicates that services inflation started easing in August but with a partial reversal in February, which came in at 0.1 percentage points above the January reading.[11] Indeed, this alternative series may better capture the severe pressure on services prices during the intense phase of pandemic reopening in the spring and summer of 2022 that was partly offset at the time by measures such as the German travel ticket scheme. In any event, these differential momentum patterns reinforce the importance of taking a granular approach to understanding inflation dynamics, since the relative contributions of the noise, reverting and underlying components may vary across categories. Moreover, in relation to core inflation, the goods and services categories are shaped by quite different forces, such that it is important to take due account of the individual trajectories of goods inflation and services inflation.[12] Chart 2 Inflation momentum (annual percentage changes; annualised percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat. Notes: Momentum is defined as annualised 3 months on 3 months rates, seasonally adjusted data. HICPX: HICP excluding energy and food. The corrected momentum series on the right panel excludes the effects of the 9 euro ticket in Germany. Latest observation: February 2023 (flash). In trying to assess the potential contribution of a reverting component to inflation dynamics, one basic question to ask is whether the recent declines in energy prices should also contribute to lower food inflation and core inflation in the coming months (over and above the operation of base effects by which earlier price increases drop out of the inflation calculation). There are two potential channels. First, energy constitutes a significant cost component for many sectors. During the phase of intense energy price increases, these put upward pressure on costs and prices in other sectors over the last eighteen months. While the impact on pricing decisions of cost declines may not be fully symmetric to the impact of cost increases, some passthrough should be expected. Second, the decline in headline inflation means that the increase in the cost of living (the overall price level) is now lower than expected in the December staff projections. In turn, all else equal, less upward pressure on the cost of living should mean a lower path for nominal wages (albeit playing out over an extended period), which is a central factor in the determination of underlying inflation. To assess passthrough from energy to core inflation (the first channel), it is helpful to look at the dynamic correlations between these two components. Chart 3 shows that there were typically negative correlations between energy inflation and core inflation in the first decade of the euro (possibly reflecting the endogenous reaction of monetary policy to headline inflation).[13] However, positive contemporaneous correlations were observed more frequently after the financial crisis. This could indicate that the speed of the pass-through from energy to core inflation has increased since the financial crisis.[14] Over the last eighteen months, the correlation of energy and core inflation has become increasingly contemporaneous – reflecting that energy has passed through very quickly to core inflation and been an important factor in the recent increase in core inflation in the euro area. This could imply that the recent decline in energy prices could also be reflected much more quickly than usual in core inflation in the euro area.

Positive correlations are shown in blue and negative correlations in red. Latest observations: February 2023. The easing of pandemic-related supply bottlenecks is a second relevant factor in assessing the role of a reverting component in inflation. Chart 4 shows the sustained easing in supply bottlenecks in recent months, with the improvement largely due to the easing of supply constraints. While the improvement in supply bottlenecks can be expected to alleviate one source of upward pressure on prices, it is not yet clear whether the upward impact of earlier supply chain problems on final consumer prices has fully played out.[15] Indeed, the current strength of goods inflation suggests that the easing of bottlenecks is not yet feeding through into retail prices, even if there are indications of easing at the intermediate stage in the pricing chain.

The SVAR model in the right-hand side panel shows the contribution of aggregate demand (due to demand and interest rate shocks) and aggregate supply (due to supply-chain disruption, energy and other cost-push shocks) forces (see also De Santis, Economic Bulletin, Issue 8/2021). The model is identified using sign and narrative restrictions as in Antolín‑Díaz, J. and Rubio-Ramírez, J.F., “Narrative Sign Restrictions for SVARs”, American Economic Review, Vol. 108, No 10, 2018, pp. 2802‑2829. The latest observations are for February 2023. This is illustrated in Chart 5. Early in the pricing chain, producer price inflation and import price inflation for intermediate goods have been decreasing strongly since April 2022 – reflecting lower pressures from input costs including energy and raw materials. These appear to have fed through now also to later stages of the pricing chain with import prices for non-food consumer goods decreasing from 8.6% in October to 7.0% in November and 5.8% in December. Producer prices for non-food consumer goods as the most important leading indicator for goods inflation have also decreased in January after strong previous increases and moderated from 9.4% in December to 8.8% in January 2023. Based on these developments the ECB’s indicator for producer price pressures (IPPI) estimates that the pressures on goods inflation are likely to be close to their peak and to decline over 2023.[16] However, there remain upside risks to the extent that previous increases in pipeline pressures have not yet fully passed through to goods inflation.

Right panel: 2023Q1 (based on January and February) for goods inflation, 2023Q4 for the IPPI. The pandemic has affected inflation dynamics not only through supply bottlenecks but also through the supply-demand mismatches associated initially with lockdown episodes and subsequently with the sustained re-opening of the euro area economy over the last year. As shown in Chart 6, limits to short-term supply elasticities meant that the recovery in demand enabled firms to also increase profit margins in those sectors exhibiting supply-demand mismatches. To the extent that supply capacity should improve over time and demand patterns normalise, the extraordinary conditions underpinning profitability in 2022 should not persist, with a decline in profit margins translating into lower inflationary pressures. Chart 6 Sectoral wage and profit developments (left: change since 2019 Q4 to 2022 Q3; right: gross operating surplus over real value added, level) Sources: Eurostat, and ECB staff calculations. Notes: Wages refer to compensation of employees, profits to gross operating surplus. Income for self-employed people is included in wages. Latest observations are for 2022 Q3.. These factors can be jointly illustrated through supply-demand decompositions for goods inflation and services inflation, as is shown in Charts 7 and 8.[17] For both goods and services, supply factors continue to exert a strong influence on inflation. Lower energy costs, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the lagged increase in supply capacity in response to the pandemic reopening should ease the supply component of inflation over time.

Seasonally adjusted data. Decomposition based on Shapiro, A.H. (2022). Services inflation is the sum of demand-driven, supply-driven and ambiguous components, calculated as the trailing sum of the last 12 monthly contributions. While price data are available for January 2023, the latest observation is for December 2022 as the turnover series used as a proxy for activity are published with some delay. Latest observation: December 2022. An alternative decomposition for the services sector is shown in Chart 9. This decomposition divides the services sector into four sub-categories: (a) sectors that are both contact-intensive and energy-intensive (33.0 per cent of total services expenditure); (b) sectors that are contact-intensive but not energy-intensive (6.3 per cent of total services expenditure); (c) sectors that are energy-intensive but not contact-intensive (10.2 per cent of total services expenditure); and (d) sectors that are neither contact-intensive nor energy-intensive (50.4 per cent of total services expenditure). We should expect the combined impact of the pandemic cycle and the energy shock to be strongest in category (a) and weakest in category (d). Indeed, we see that the contribution from category (d) has increased only very gradually, while the contribution from category (a) has gone from about zero in the middle of 2021 to about two percentage points of services inflation in January 2023. That is, nearly half of services inflation is being generated by the category that is most affected by the energy shock and pandemic-related factors. To the extent that the reversal in energy costs and the easing of pandemic-related factors reduces pricing pressures in this category, this highly atypical configuration may not persist. Chart 9 Services inflation – decomposition into contact-intensive and energy-sensitive items Annual percentage change and percentage point contributions Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations. Notes: Energy sensitive component based on items with a share of energy in total (direct and indirect) costs above the average energy share across all services items. The latest observations are for February 2023 (flash) for services and January 2023 for the rest. Chart 10 provides a further perspective on the role of energy costs in determining core inflation by allocating the 211 items in the HICPX into energy-intensive and non-energy-intensive groups. Before the start of the energy surge in 2021 there was no link observed between the energy intensity (measured as the direct share of energy in input costs based on input-output tables) and the cumulative increase in inflation since December 2019. This picture changes when data up to January 2023 is taken into account: the inflation rate of HICPX items has tended to be higher, the greater the energy intensity. This can be seen as indicating the outsized contribution of energy to core inflation when energy inflation is very high. The important role of the surge in energy prices observed since the start of 2021 is also reflected by a sub-aggregate of HICPX including only those items with an energy share above average, which increased by 6.7 per cent in January 2023 (albeit down from 7.0 per cent in December 2022), whereas the inflation rate for the sub-aggregate of HICPX with an energy share below average stood at 4.3% in January (albeit up from 3.9% in December 2022). The right panel of Chart 10 also shows that inflation for the wage-sensitive sectors within HICPX has been increasing steadily, even if remaining at a much lower level than the energy-sensitive component or overall core inflation. We next turn to the inter-connections between wage inflation and price inflation. Chart 10 Role of energy for HICPX inflation (left: energy share in direct costs (x axis, percentage) and cumulated price changes in since December 2019 (y axis, percentage changes) for 211 HICPX sub items; right: annual percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations. Notes: Energy-sensitive component based on items with a share of energy in total (direct and indirect) costs above the average energy share across all HICPX items. The latest observations are for February 2023 (flash) for HICPX and Services, 2022 Q4 for negotiated wages and January 2023 for the rest. Wage inflation and price inflation The importance of labour costs in total costs in many sectors (especially in the services category) means that wage inflation is deeply inter-connected with price inflation. Furthermore, the staggered, infrequent and decentralised nature of wage setting means that it is likely to take several years for wages to adjust fully to the surprise price inflation that has already occurred.[18] In this way, the wage adjustment process may put upward pressure on price inflation over the next two or three years, even if the long-term behaviour of wages were ultimately unaffected by the current inflation shock (with the stability of long-term inflation expectations and aligned long-term wage dynamics reinforcing each other). That is, once the equilibrium level of real wages has been attained after the wage catch- up phase, we might expect nominal wages to grow at the rate corresponding to the sum of labour productivity growth and the two per cent inflation target. Chart 11 Nominal and real wage growth (consumer wages) (index: Q4 2020 = 100) Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations.Notes: Real compensation per employee and per hour are deflated by HICP (consumer wages). The latest observations are for the third quarter of 2022. Chart 11 shows that wage inflation has been below consumer price inflation since the start of 2021, resulting in a decline in real consumer wages: for instance, the real value of compensation per employee declined around 5 percentage points below the 2021Q1 level.[19] This can largely be attributed to the unexpected and sudden nature of the increase in inflation. While some decline in real wages may be in line with the adverse terms of trade shock associated with the surge in energy prices, some catchup in real wages can be expected. Indeed, the ECB indicator of negotiated wage rates, available up to December 2022, reflects a gradual increase in wage pressures since the beginning of 2021.[20] Abstracting from one-off payments, there was a steady but quite contained increase in this series through the fourth quarter of 2022, with the latest values of annual growth rate around three per cent. Allowing for typical labour productivity growth of about one per cent per year, a nominal wage growth of three per cent per year would be broadly aligned with delivering our two per cent medium-term inflation target. Chart 12 Experimental forward-looking tracker of negotiated wage growth in the euro area (annual percentage changes) Sources: ECB calculations based on micro-data on wage agreements provided by Bundesbank, Banco de España, the Dutch employer association AWVN, Banca d’Italia, Banque de France, Bank of Greece and Oesterreichische Nationalbank. Note: The euro area aggregate is based on data from Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherland, Austria and Greece. Indeed wage tracker: Data on nominal wage growth in job postings covers six euro area countries (DE, ES, FR, IE, IT and NL) and is based on “Wage growth in euro area countries: evidence from job ads” – P. Adrjan & R. Lydon, Economic Letter, Central Bank of Ireland, Vol 2022, No. 7. The latest observations are for December 2022. However, as shown in Chart 12, there are two indicators that suggest that the negotiated wage indicator understates the current degree of nominal wage momentum. First, a broader forward-looking experimental tracker of negotiated wage growth has been developed by the ECB in cooperation with national central banks (Chart 12).[21] This wage tracker aggregates information from collective bargaining agreements across euro area countries and includes information on the latest wage increases that have been agreed for 2023.[22] Contract negotiations during 2022 have typically delivered a 4.4 per cent wage increase for 2022 and a 4.8 per cent increase for 2023. Additionally, the wage increases agreed for 2023 have shifted upwards towards the end of the year over 2022. This suggests that nominal negotiated wage growth based on latest agreements is set to be higher this year compared with the level that would be consistent in the medium term with the two per cent overall inflation target. A second wage growth tracker based on Indeed job postings data has been developed by Adrjan and Lydon (2022).[23] These data reflect the pay offered to the marginal worker (a new hire). At the same time, it should be recognised that, in a tight labour market, hiring wages are likely to outpace the wages offered to existing workers such that the level of the wage growth tracker is not necessarily an indicator of the expected future level of aggregate growth in negotiated wages. Rather, it is more likely to serve as a leading indicator of the momentum in wage dynamics. For instance, the earlier pickup in this wage tracker since summer 2021 foreshadowed the subsequent pickup in the negotiated wage growth measure and the strong increases in the wage tracker indicator during 2022 suggest that there will be further increases in the growth rate of overall negotiated wages. At the same time, this tracker shows some tentative signs of easing in the latest readings. In view of these developments, the December 2022 Eurosystem staff projections were based on an assessment that compensation per employee growth will increase from 4.5 per cent in 2022 to 5.2 per cent in 2023, 4.5 per cent in 2024 and 3.9 per cent in 2025 and unit labour costs by 3.2, 5.0, 3.1 and 2.6 per cent, respectively.[24] The higher-than-normal nominal wage increases largely reflect the catch up process following the drop in real wages that has occurred since the middle of 2021. These rates of high wage growth are expected to lead to a rotation toward wage growth as a main driver of underlying inflation in the euro area (Chart 13). The contribution of wage intensive items – defined as those HICPX items for which wages account for more than 40 per cent of input costs – has increased with the upward trend of wage pressures after the pandemic but has so far remained moderate. However, the high levels of wage growth projected for 2023 and 2024 can be expected to make wages an increasingly dominant driver of underlying inflation in the euro area. Accordingly, on an ongoing basis, the close inspection of the latest wage developments is a high priority in assessing underlying inflation. Chart 13 Decomposition of HICPX inflation by wage intensity of items (annual percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations. Note: HICPX wage sensitive items are a composite measure based on items with a share of wages in direct costs above 40%. Forecast based on the December Eurosystem staff projections. Latest observation: February 2023 (flash) for HICPX, January 2023 for wage intensity and 2024 for forecast. Inflation expectations There is a clear risk that an extended period of above-target inflation may induce consumers, workers, firms and financial market participants to re-consider their beliefs about the future path of inflation, especially if the behavioural norm for many economic agents is to follow adaptive belief-formation processes by which high current inflation generates a persistent increase in the expected future inflation rate.[25] Chart 14 summarises a range of indicators of inflation expectations. Panel A shows that one-year ahead inflation expectations eased slightly and the three-year ahead inflation expectations remained stable in the December vintage of the Consumer Expectations Survey, with both measures well below the current inflation rate, suggesting that consumers interpret that there is a high temporary component in current inflation.[26] While the three-year ahead expectation jumped at the start of the war in March 2022, it has remained quite stable since then. Panel B shows that professional forecasters expect inflation to return close to target over the medium term.[27] As captured in Panel C, market-based measures also indicate a rapid decline in inflation over 2023 and 2024. While the cost of inflation protection has increased recently at longer horizons (as reflected in the 5yr5yr rate in Panel D), this can be interpreted as largely reflecting an increase in the inflation risk premium.[28] This increase in inflation risk compensation reflects the high current uncertainty about inflation dynamics (both in the euro area and globally).

An inflation heatmap The basic theme of this speech is that underlying inflation measures can only be properly interpreted in the context of a wider assessment of the incidence of shocks driving the economic outlook. To this end, a heatmap that reports a wide range of ancillary measures may be helpful. A heatmap, showing where a given indicator lies compared to its distribution since 2018, points to a mixed picture, with some signs of easing pressures (Chart 15). The first feature that emerges from the heatmap is the transmission of the price pressures along the pricing chain, with “red spots” generally emerging first on the commodity front and then showing up in producer prices and further “downstream”. Compared to the peaks during the re-opening phase of last year, the latest observations point to weaker pressures from the energy commodities, non-energy and non-food commodities, global and domestic economic activity and supply side bottlenecks. By contrast, stronger pressures are indicated by the indicators for food-related costs and labour market developments, in particular from the tight labour market and from wage growth. Generally, producer price pressures are still elevated, reflecting recent increases in input costs. Overall, the heatmap suggests still strong inflationary pressures, but some signs of easing are emerging.

Most of the variables are expressed in annual growth rates.

Conclusions In this lecture, I have highlighted that the monitoring of underlying inflation is an essential input into the monetary policy process. I have emphasised that an accurate assessment of underlying inflation is especially tricky in view of the large dislocations that have hit the economy, since the energy crisis and the pandemic have generated inflation shocks that do not fit neatly into either the “pure noise” or “medium term” components of inflation but rather also plausibly contribute to a “reverting” component of inflation. Differentiating the reverting and medium-term components of inflation the main analytical challenge and is inevitably subject to high uncertainty.[29] There are no short cuts in the analysis of underlying inflation, which requires a comprehensive multi-variate and multi-method assessment. In particular, the tracking of underlying inflation must rely on a wide range of data sources and take full account of the latest developments. This reinforces the value of a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to monetary policy decision making, especially in conjunction with the importance of measuring the impact of the cumulative tightening in the monetary policy stance that has already occurred. For the ECB, the monetary policy priority is to make sure that inflation returns to target in a timely manner. The current information on underlying inflation pressures suggests that it will be appropriate to raise rates further beyond our March meeting, while the exact calibration beyond March should reflect the information contained in the upcoming macroeconomic projections, together with the incoming data on inflation and the operation of the monetary transmission mechanism. By bringing the key policy rates to a sufficiently restrictive level and fostering a period of below-trend growth through the dampening of demand, we will counter-act above-target medium-term inflation pressures and also ensure that the prolonged phase of above-target inflation does not become embedded through a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. In particular, the dampening of demand through the tightening of monetary policy means that price setters and wage setters are on notice that excessive price and wage increases will not be sustainable. Looking at the upcoming data flows between our March and May meetings, our evolving assessment will be informed by: the inflation outcomes for March and April; the Q1 GDP data flash release; the range of sentiment indices (including PMIs and other indicators); new editions of our own surveys (the Corporate Telephone Survey, the Survey of Monetary Analysts, the Consumer Expectations Survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Bank Lending Survey); the updated information on employment and wage dynamics; incoming data on credit creation and bank lending rates; and, in relation to fiscal policy, the Stability Programme Updates that will be submitted in April from the member states.

Of course, a two-step approach to assessing inflation is nothing new. For instance, when inflation was anticipated to remain persistently below target, the ECB adopted in July 2021 a forward guidance framework that formalised the cross-checking dual roles of the inflation forecast and underlying inflation in underpinning monetary policy decisions.

Eventually, the (partial or full) real wage adjustment process will be complete, so there should not be an impact on longer-term inflation dynamics. The dramatic easing in gas prices can be interpreted as a favourable supply shock, which also should generate an improvement in the GDP outlook. For a comprehensive discussion, see Lane, P.R.

The momentum indicator for headline inflation stood at 3.1 percent in February, down from 5.5 in January. The temporary subsidized public transport ticket in Germany (“9-euro ticket”) reduced the services price index in June, July and August 2022. In February 2023, the effect of the 9 euro ticket fell out of the time window for calculating 3 months on 3 months inflation rates. Of course, this scheme is just one of many temporary fiscal interventions that are influencing inflation dynamics across the euro area. In the December staff projections, fiscal interventions were assessed to lower the inflation rate in 2022 and 2023 but then to raise the inflation rate in 2024 and 2025 in line with the scheduled expiry of these measures.

7f56e515a3136268af7fc13ce918129df8a8cf1f,2019-07-11,speech,Inflation expectations and the conduct of monetary policy,Benoît Cœuré,,all_ECB_speeches.csv,"Inflation expectations and the conduct of monetary policy Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at an event organised by the SAFE Policy Center, Frankfurt am Main, 11 July 2019 Stable inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability provide an important nominal anchor for the economy. They reduce inflation persistence and curb harmful macroeconomic volatility. There is compelling empirical evidence suggesting that increased clarity about central banks’ mandates, their reaction functions and inflation aims has helped anchor inflation expectations and reduce their variability around the communicated inflation aim despite significant shocks to inflation in both directions.[1] However, persistently low inflation since the great financial crisis has led some central bank observers, and financial market participants in particular, to question the ability of central banks to deliver on their mandate. In the euro area, where the coordinating role of a nominal anchor is particularly important in view of cross-country differences in wage and price-setting, market-based long-term inflation expectations have fallen since the crisis, and this fall has accelerated since the start of the year. These developments have sparked a discussion on two related questions. The first question, which I have discussed on previous occasions, is whether the fall in market-based inflation expectations reflects a growing belief that the ECB’s policy space is significantly reduced at the zero lower bound.[2] The second question is whether similar shifts in the expected inflation outlook can be observed in the wider economy – that is, whether, and to what extent, market-based inflation expectations affect actual inflation outcomes and can become self-fulfilling by unleashing perilous second-round effects. The decline in market-based inflation expectations The first question is, in short, a discussion about the ECB’s credibility. While there is no room for complacency, I would argue that there are three arguments that provide some ground for comfort. The first is that the drop in long-term market-based inflation expectations has been a global phenomenon, including jurisdictions where policy rates are currently well above the zero lower bound. This suggests that concerns by market participants likely extend well beyond the realm of monetary policy. The second argument is that survey-based inflation expectations, such as the ones collected by the ECB in its Survey of Professional Forecasters, have stayed consistently above market-based measures, and closer to the ECB’s definition of price stability. The third argument relates to the precise anatomy of the decline in market-based inflation expectations. ECB staff analysis suggests that market-based expectations are much more in line with survey-based inflation expectations once one corrects for the inflation risk premium – that is, the compensation investors demand for bearing risks related to the uncertainty around the future inflation path. You can see this on the left-hand side of my first slide, which shows a breakdown of inflation-linked swap rates into expected inflation and an inflation risk premium. It suggests that about 80% of the drop in the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, both since the start of 2014 and in 2019, is due to a drop in the risk premium. Actual expectations have fallen to a much smaller extent. In other words, while expectations of a surge in euro area demand and inflation, as typically captured by a rising inflation risk premium, have been significantly cut, expectations about the baseline have remained more stable. Yet, while shifts in risk premia can explain the bulk of recent developments in long-term inflation expectations, they can explain much less of the recent fall in short and medium-term expectations, which you can see on the right-hand side of this slide. Three-quarters or more of the decline in short and medium-term maturity inflation swap rates since the autumn of last year reflect a genuine fall in inflation expectations. Such a drop in short and medium-term inflation expectations is particularly remarkable in an environment where highly volatile inflation components, such as energy prices, have remained relatively stable, and have even been rising since the start of the year. Recent market developments therefore suggest expectations that the current weakness in euro area and global demand will persist. Households are not professional forecasters This brings me to the second question as to whether similar shifts in the expected inflation outlook can be observed outside financial markets.[3] One drawback of much of the empirical work on the role of inflation expectations is that it has largely assumed that all measures of expectations are interchangeable – that households and firms can be assumed to have expectations akin to those of professional forecasters or financial market participants.[4] In reality, reliable data on inflation expectations of consumers or firms are scarce. I will return to firms in a minute but one reason for the lack of consumer expectations data is that several field studies have found that many people’s inflation perceptions are substantially different from actual inflation outcomes.[5] For example, based on an experimental dataset maintained by the European Commission, households believed that annual euro area inflation between 2004 and 2018 was close to 9%, when in fact it was 1.6%.[6] Similar gaps have been found in the United States and elsewhere.[7] Moreover, many households are not aware of central banks’ inflation aims. In the United States, for example, a recent survey showed that only a quarter of surveyed households knew of the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation aim.[8] This clearly suggests that central banks need to do much more to bring the monetary policy discussion to the broader public, and thereby improve their accountability.[9] Yet, there is convincing evidence that, although households may not be able to correctly identify the current level of inflation, they have a fairly good understanding of changes in the trend of current inflation, and that these changes are likely to inform their expectations about future inflation.[10] You can see this on my next slide. What you can see here is actual HICP inflation together with qualitative consumer inflation expectations for the following year, computed as a balance statistic which is the difference between the share of respondents who expect prices to rise and the share of those who expect prices to fall, or to stay about the same.[11] The correlation with actual inflation is remarkable. Much of this correlation is typically driven by price developments in some of the goods and services that consumers purchase more frequently. To put it simply, if goods are purchased more regularly, price changes are more likely to be noticed.[12] You can see this on the left-hand side of my next slide, which relates household inflation expectations to annual inflation in energy and unprocessed food – products for which most consumers typically have a good understanding of price developments. Clearly, the correlation is much closer than when these two product categories are excluded, as you can see on the right-hand side. What is more, data on consumers’ inflation expectations indeed suggest that developments in market-based inflation expectations are often representative of trends in the wider economy. You can see this on my next slide. Changes in the direction of household inflation expectations are typically very similar to those of professional forecasters, which are shown on the left-hand side, and financial market participants, which are shown on the right-hand side, at least for horizons of up to one or two years. In other words, most individuals – whether financial investors, teachers or nurses – use simple rules of thumb to form their short-term inflation expectations. And current inflation seems to be the most widely used heuristic in this respect, making some degree of inflation persistence a natural and inevitable phenomenon. Developments over the past year, however, mark a clear and visible departure from past regularities. As you can see on the right-hand chart, a growing gap has emerged between the inflation expectations of market participants on the one side, and households and professional forecasters on the other. This is not about differences in the level, which – as I have argued before – may not mean much. This is about different dynamics, with the two-year moving correlation between market-based and household expectations dropping from 0.8 in the summer of last year to below 0.3 in June, the lowest level in nearly nine years. So, unlike the situation in late 2014 and early 2015, when inflation expectations fell sharply across the population, and when we launched the asset purchase programme, today households are much less sceptical about the future. This raises two important questions. The first is what happens to inflation if financial market participants and households hold diverging views on the future direction of inflation. The second question is why we are seeing this divergence in views, and whether it is temporary or likely to persist. Let me try to answer each of these two questions in turn. Which expectations matter most? Existing research casts some doubt on the macroeconomic relevance of professional inflation forecasts, including those of financial markets. There are three related strands in the literature that suggest that household inflation expectations are often better predictors of future inflation outcomes.[13] The first is that financial market participants are not particularly good at predicting future inflation. I’m not claiming that central banks are particularly better. You can see this on my next slide. But as you can see on the following one, financial market participants repeatedly failed to correctly project even the very near-term outlook for inflation in the euro area. There are two sides to this finding. One is the automatic stabilising role that market-based inflation expectations play despite, or precisely because of, their poor track-record in projecting inflation. As market participants react in real time to any news potentially relevant for the medium-term inflation outlook, they support the monetary policy transmission process: they tend to frontload accommodation when inflation risks are skewed to the downside, and they tend to remove accommodation when risks are tilted to the upside. You can see this on my next slide, which shows the breakdown of the ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rate into its real and nominal components. Clearly, shifts in inflation expectations can, at times, have a significant impact on financial conditions and hence on economic developments. The other side of the coin is that, while a poor track-record in projecting inflation may not necessarily discourage their broader use in the economy, it is the high frequency of their revisions that probably makes market-based inflation expectations a less reliable and useful yardstick for social partners, firms and households in wage and price-setting, and hence a less reliable predictor of future inflation. The second reason is that households’ inflation expectations affect their consumption decisions, and hence growth and aggregate price developments.[14] That is, when consumers expect inflation to rise, they tend to spend more today, much in line with the classical (real) interest rate transmission channel of monetary policy. You can see ECB research on this on my next slide. There is a discernible positive relationship between households’ reported willingness to spend and the change they expect in inflation.[15] The third, and possibly most important, reason is that household inflation expectations have been found to be a better proxy of firms’ pricing decisions than those of professional forecasters or financial market participants. For example, research found that using household inflation expectations in an otherwise standard Phillips curve framework fits US inflation data better over a large sample. This includes the aftermath of the great financial crisis and was put forward as one factor explaining the “missing” disinflation puzzle in the United States.[16] ECB staff find similar evidence for predicting wage growth in the euro area. You can see this on my next slide. Although the results need to be treated with caution given the short sample, a wage Phillips curve regression using household inflation expectations would have provided the best out-of-sample fit for euro area wage growth over the course of last year. For financial market-based inflation expectations, the prediction error would have been more than twice as large. The few surveys that exist for firms’ inflation expectations corroborate these findings. The most comprehensive evidence exists for New Zealand, where firms’ expectations were found to be much closer to those of households.[17] In the United States, more than half of the survey respondents on a panel of firms in manufacturing and services said they were simply not able to report their point forecasts for inflation over the next 12 months, consistent with the evidence found for households.[18] The implication is that, even though financing conditions largely depend on the expectations of financial markets, what ultimately matters for growth and inflation outcomes is how firms and households expect prices and wages to evolve in the future. And so, while policymakers should never ignore signals coming from financial markets, they should not focus on them too narrowly either. The pessimism priced into bond markets today may not necessarily presage downward pressure on inflation tomorrow – at least not to the same extent. How stable are household inflation expectations? The second question relates to why inflation expectations between households and financial market participants are diverging at the current juncture. There is no easy answer. One reason for the recent resilience in household inflation expectations may simply relate to the relative stability of the prices for some of the goods and services that consumers purchase more frequently. Looking through the ups and downs, inflation in energy and unprocessed food has been, on average, 4.5% between January 2018 and today, and it has never fallen below 2% during the course of 2019. A second, and more benign, reason could relate to a change in how consumers extrapolate and generalise price changes in frequently purchased products. Although the available data do not allow drawing definitive conclusions as to whether medium-term household inflation expectations have remained stable, my last slide suggests that they have. It shows a very crude “deanchoring” measure, which combines, at each point in time, those euro area households that expect inflation to either “increase more rapidly” or “to fall” over the coming year – that is, expectations that are potentially not consistent with the ECB’s definition of price stability, depending on the state of the economy. On the left-hand side, I show this measure together with an index of current inflation perceptions that weighs those households that perceive prices to have “risen a lot” with those who perceive them to have “fallen” over the past 12 months. Clearly, while there was a correlation between these two indices in the 1980s and 1990s, this relationship weakened, and practically vanished, after the introduction of the euro. That is, euro area households, as a whole, do not expect prices to rise more rapidly in the future even in periods in which they perceive prices to have increased a lot over the previous 12 months. On the right-hand side, you can see the same measure together with the HICP for energy and unprocessed food. From this chart it is clear that stability works in both directions. For example, the index barely moved when energy and food prices dropped sharply in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and it hardly moved when they rose markedly towards the end of 2016. Such broad signs of anchoring – going beyond professional forecasters and financial markets – would also be consistent with empirical evidence that confirms that announcing an official inflation aim has contributed to reducing costly inflation persistence in a large group of developed and emerging economies, including the euro area.[19] In other words, even though households continue to take current inflation into account when forming their expectations, the success of central banks in bringing inflation down to low and stable levels might have contributed to cutting the tails in the distribution of future expected inflation.[20] Such effects may have thereby helped to offset, at least partially, the consequences of other secular forces that have tended to make inflation more persistent.[21] Conclusion Stable inflation expectations play a crucial role for the effectiveness of monetary policy. For this and other reasons, central banks have over time radically changed the way they communicate with the public. While increased central bank transparency has undoubtedly been successful in anchoring inflation expectations, the protracted period of low inflation has caused concerns among financial market participants that current subdued underlying price pressures will persist in the medium term. The Governing Council is taking these concerns seriously. At the same time, euro area households seem to look with much less scepticism into the future. Their inflation expectations have remained more stable since the start of the year, and today remain close to a six-year high. There is also tentative evidence suggesting that household inflation expectations are better predictors of future inflation outcomes and that euro area consumers have become less likely to expect inflation outcomes that would be inconsistent with the ECB’s definition of price stability. All this confirms the need for central banks to consider and analyse developments in a broad set of inflation expectations indicators with a view to gauging risks to future price developments.

Despite growing COVID-19 incidence numbers, consumers and firms are becoming more upbeat about the future. The European Commission’s economic sentiment indicator has improved markedly since the beginning of the year and was near record highs in August. At the same time, consumer prices are increasing at a faster pace, following years of very low inflation. In August, inflation in the euro area stood at 3%, significantly exceeding the 2% mark that the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has defined as its new medium-term inflation target (Slide 2). In Germany, the inflation rate, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), hit 3.4% in August – a level not seen in 13 years. And it is likely to continue growing until the end of the year. People are understandably worried about these developments. Higher inflation lowers the purchasing power and reduces wages and interest income in real terms – that is adjusted for inflation. Real interest rates on savings deposits in Germany are now visibly negative after the recent increase in inflation (Slide 3). Negative real interest rates are nothing out of the ordinary per se. Both before and after the euro was introduced, there were longer periods of negative real interest rates.[1] The most recent spike in consumer prices, however, coincided with a phase of very low or even negative nominal interest rates, which compounds people’s worries. Indeed, since the ECB’s key interest rates were last lowered in September 2019, we have seen commercial banks increasingly passing negative nominal interest rates on to their customers. Since then, the share of bank deposits of private households that are subject to negative rates has more than doubled in some euro area countries, although still only 9% of all deposits in these countries are affected (Slide 4). At 43%, the share of corporate deposits affected is already much higher. These concerns affect us as central bankers directly – given that the ECB has a clear mandate to ensure price stability. It is therefore important to offer a factual explanation for the recent price increases and an assessment of future risks, especially in Germany where many supposed experts and the media are again rousing people’s fears without explaining the reasons behind the price movements (Slide 5). Allusions are being made to conditions in the Weimar Republic. Comparisons are being drawn to the 1970s, when inflation in Germany was almost 8%. And there are warnings of a “meltdown” and a “runaway train” if interest rates remain low. In my remarks today, I would like to address these inflation fears. I will start by providing an assessment of recent developments in consumer prices against the backdrop of the long phase of very low inflation and explain why inflation in the euro area, and also in Germany, is likely to ease noticeably next year. A premature monetary policy tightening in response to a temporary rise in inflation would choke the recovery and be most harmful to those who are already suffering from the current spike in inflation. Finally, I will explain why the higher inflation we are seeing now may actually be positive news. There are good reasons to assume that the current constellation of fiscal and monetary policy in the euro area may finally chart the path out of the low interest rate environment. New monetary policy strategy as yardstick and compass The assessment of current and future inflation lies at the heart of our monetary policy decisions that we take to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole. About every six weeks – and most recently last week – we look at a broad range of economic indicators to assess the future path of inflation. So how do we assess the current situation? Will the much-invoked “flood of money” really cause the “great inflation”? Yardstick and compass of our assessment of the risks to price stability is our new monetary policy strategy, which was adopted unanimously by the Governing Council in July.[2] The key element of this strategy is a new, symmetric inflation target of 2% over the medium term, which replaced our previous target of below, but close to, 2%. To many, this adjustment may seem insignificant. However, it is anything but, and the reason is simple – our new target makes it abundantly clear that we consider sustained negative and positive deviations of inflation from our target as equally undesirable. This clarification matters because the previous definition had occasionally been misinterpreted. Some had seen it as a ceiling, assuming that while inflation must not exceed it, undershooting it would not be a problem. The truth is that, in recent years, our challenge has been inflation that was too low rather than too high. Since the global financial crisis, the inflation rate in the euro area has on average been just 1.2% (Slide 2). In Germany, it has been only slightly higher, at 1.3%. In the ten years before the introduction of the euro, inflation in Germany had on average been more than twice as high. For most people, the dangers of too high inflation are immediately obvious. However, many do not understand why too low inflation may also pose risks to price stability. This is what I would like to briefly explain now.[3] In the past years inflation expectations in the euro area have declined markedly. This becomes clear when looking at financial markets, where such expectations are formed every day. Just before the pandemic broke out, financial market participants were expecting an inflation rate of approximately just 1.3% in the euro area in the long term, which was significantly below our target of 2% (Slide 6). Lower inflation expectations largely reflected scepticism and doubts about the euro area’s long-term growth prospects, which had been gradually deteriorating in the years leading up to the pandemic. Conditions in the labour market are testimony to this. Some 13 years after the start of the global financial crisis, the unemployment rate in the euro area excluding Germany is still higher than in 2008, before the financial crisis (Slide 7). A high level of structural unemployment dampens aggregate demand and leads to a situation where many firms are less profitable because they cannot pass through increased costs to their customers. This, in turn, pushes inflation down. Wage increases are then lower, too, and people spend less on goods and services, creating a vicious circle. Demographic change threatens to further exacerbate these issues in the future. In Germany, the labour force is expected to shrink by almost 12% by 2035 (Slide 8). An ageing population weakens expected future demand and may discourage firms from investing in innovative and efficiency-boosting technologies. In the 1980s, annual productivity growth in the euro area was 2%. It has more than halved since. These trends hurt economic growth and employment and they reduce monetary policy’s precious room for manoeuvre in a crisis. This is linked to the two key determinants of nominal interest rates: expected long-term growth and inflation expectations. If they fall, so do interest rates. This is exactly what we have seen in recent years. Owing to low inflation and growth expectations, the yield on ten-year German sovereign bonds fell from almost 10% in the early 1980s to less than 1% in 2014 (Slide 9), before the ECB began purchasing bonds as part of its monetary policy. Today the nominal yield is negative. Central banks cannot lower interest rates arbitrarily since a deeply negative nominal rate would lead to a flight from bank deposits and boost the demand for cash, which has a nominal interest rate of 0%. Hence, very low interest rates ultimately limit the ECB’s room for manoeuvre in stabilising the economy in times of crisis. This is referred to as the effective lower bound. The pandemic is a good example. Despite the most serious crisis in post-war history, we did not lower our key interest rates last year – which would have been the normal reaction to a severe crisis – because they had already been at or just below zero for seven years (Slide 10). The 2008 global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis that followed largely exhausted the scope for lowering interest rates in the first half of the last decade already, even if we have not yet reached the effective lower bound. Instead, we supported the economy in these difficult times by purchasing bonds, that is fixed-income securities. Bond purchases work through a simple principle: by increasing the demand for securities in the market, their prices rise and their long-term yields fall. Many international studies show that bond purchases can be effective in supporting the financing conditions for firms and households. However, using such measures over a long period of time may cause side effects, mostly because bond purchases directly interfere with the way financial markets work and can in the long run give rise to adverse incentives for governments and investors. Our new symmetric inflation target can better contain these risks in the future by preventing a lasting decrease in inflation expectations, and hence in nominal interest rates. When the general public has a better understanding of the dangers of too low inflation, it will adjust its expectations of the future monetary policy stance accordingly. And more stable inflation expectations, in turn, give rise to positive feedback effects on wage and price-setting and so on actual inflation, growth and employment. In order to strengthen this mechanism, we have decided to commit to especially forceful or persistent monetary policy measures when we are close to the effective lower bound. The new inflation target in an environment of rising inflation How, then, exactly is our new strategy affecting monetary policy in the current environment of rising inflation? Does the significant increase in consumer prices mean that we should reduce asset purchases and increase interest rates? In our July Governing Council meeting, we translated our strategy into a specific expectation of the future direction of our monetary policy. Our forward guidance sets out two conditions for raising policy rates. Medium-term price development relevant for monetary policy First, we emphasise that we will not react to short-term inflation fluctuations. We want inflation to stabilise at 2% in the medium term in order to durably pave the way out of the low interest rate environment. Despite the current high inflation rates, this condition is not yet fulfilled. Contrary to some predictions, our baseline scenario foresees inflation in the euro area to weaken significantly as of the start of next year before falling below our target of 2% again (Slide 11). This is because the inflation rate is currently significantly affected by statistical effects. Put simply, inflation is so high now because it was so low last year. The VAT cut in Germany in July 2020 and the steep decline in commodity prices as a result of the pandemic led to inflation falling into negative territory for a significant period of time last year in Germany and in the euro area as a whole. These “base effects” are particularly visible when we look at how prices developed compared with their pre-crisis levels. While consumer prices grew 3% year-on-year in August, they are just 2.8% higher than in 2019, resulting in an average annual growth of just 1.4% (Slide 12). So, if we adjust for the base effects from the pandemic, inflation today remains too low rather than too high. Inflation is higher when we include the costs of housing, but this does not change our fundamental assessment of price dynamics. So far, because of statistical challenges and data issues, the HICP, which is calculated by the EU statistical office Eurostat, only takes into account the development of rents, but not the costs of owner-occupied housing. As part of our strategy review, we have recommended changing this. We have presented an ambitious roadmap at the end of which, in a few years’ time, we will be able to base our monetary policy decisions on an index that better reflects the costs of housing. Until then, we will look at housing costs separately. There is, however, one peculiarity that needs to be considered: owner-occupied properties are also investments, similarly to bonds, shares or gold. As central banks across the world generally base their monetary policy on consumer prices, investments in assets are not taken into account in inflation measurement. In practice, however, the investment and consumer components of residential properties can hardly be distinguished. Our calculations show that statistical models aiming to calculate the hypothetical price share of land run the risk of significantly underestimating the actual cost of living. A better option would be to refer to the prices that were actually paid, but to only include owner-occupied housing in the consumer price index. Investment in buy-to-let properties would then be stripped out. Preliminary calculations suggest that, under this approach, consumer price inflation in the euro area in the first quarter of this year would still have only amounted to around 1.3% instead of 1.0%, although residential real estate prices in the first quarter rose by 6.2% year-on-year – and by as much as over 10% in Germany (Slide 13). Differences of this magnitude are, of course, by no means insignificant. They highlight the importance of better reflecting people’s actual expenditure as a way of enhancing their acceptance of, and trust in, our policies. But the point is that, even when taking residential property into account, it would be misleading to allude to conditions in the Weimar Republic. There is not the slightest indication that the current monetary policy will lead to inflation permanently exceeding 2%, let alone bring about hyperinflation. At the same time, there is a broad consensus that, thanks to the measures we took during the pandemic, we prevented a severe financial crisis – and a potential deflation. The ECB’s monetary policy has thus played a significant role in the rapid economic recovery that we are seeing today, without having generated excessive inflationary risks. Avoid premature tightening of monetary policy The second condition for starting to normalise monetary policy is that we want to see our 2% target within close reach in order to avoid tightening our monetary policy stance prematurely. In principle, we align our monetary policy to the inflation expected in the medium term because the full effect of changes in interest rates on prices and wages is only gradually felt. A tightening of monetary policy is appropriate if the medium-term outlook for inflation exceeds 2%. In recent years, however, we have over-predicted medium-term inflation developments with alarming regularity (Slide 14). We repeatedly expected – as did other international organisations and commercial banks – that inflation would move towards 2% in the coming years. But these expectations were disappointed time and again. While the reasons for our forecasting errors were manifold, the consequences are identical: a systematic over-prediction of the inflation outlook increases the risks of a lasting de-anchoring of inflation expectations from the inflation target and a misalignment of monetary policy. That is why our new forward guidance now states that we will only raise interest rates if the inflation outlook over a period of one to two years, i.e. approximately in the middle of our projection horizon, reaches our target of 2% and remains at that level on a durable basis. In addition, we will only take action if realised progress in underlying inflation – broadly speaking, developments in the prices for goods and services that are less volatile than those for energy and food – is consistent with reaching our target of 2% in the medium term. Past experiences show that we have a far greater probability of reaching our target if the current rate of underlying inflation has started rising towards our inflation target. All in all, having experienced a prolonged period of too low inflation, what we want to prevent most of all is a premature tightening of monetary policy. Especially in the current environment of great uncertainty, a premature tightening could have disastrous consequences for people and would certainly not result in a sustainable end to low interest rates. A tightening of monetary policy would choke the nascent recovery and once again jeopardise the achievement of our inflation target. And it would doubtlessly exacerbate the economic and social consequences of the pandemic. The pandemic as a way out of the low interest rate environment? So we will act carefully and cautiously in the current environment. But this is not to say that interest rates will necessarily remain low for an indefinite period of time. Although we assume in our baseline scenario that inflation will fall back below 2% in the medium term, we are very diligently monitoring whether the underlying forecast assumptions might not underestimate the possibility of higher inflation over the coming years. As inflation expectations are still low, the prospect of persistently excessive inflation, as feared by some, remains highly unlikely in the euro area. The real question is whether we can reach our inflation target of 2% any sooner than we are now forecasting. Inflation of 2% in the medium term would be good news for the euro area. It would pave the way out of the low interest rate environment. In current circumstances, three developments call for our particular attention.[4] Longer-term supply bottlenecks could increase price pressure The first development relates to the special effects of the pandemic. There are growing indications that the current supply disruptions and commodity shortages could be prolonged. Producer prices are continuing to surge – in Germany as strongly as not seen since 1975 (Slide 15) –, the global shortage of microchips is causing more and more production stoppages and the vaccination rates in many emerging economies remain at a level that imperils the resilience of global value chains. A recent survey by the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce showed that only around a fifth of the close to 3,000 participating companies expected to see the situation ease before the end of this year.[5] A majority anticipates that the shortages will last into next year. The longer the supply chain problems persist, the greater the likelihood that firms will pass through their cost increases into consumer prices. Indeed, we now see that an increasing number of firms in the euro area, and in Germany, are raising their prices and further price increases are to be expected in the near future (Slide 16). We are monitoring these risks carefully, not least because during the pandemic – by contrast with the period before the crisis − we generally underestimated rather than overestimated the path of inflation (Slide 14). Higher growth path through wide-reaching reforms and structural change The second point is that our models may not be able to appropriately reflect the wide-reaching structural consequences of the pandemic. We observe a radical change in the corporate landscape. The pandemic has accelerated digitalisation and the related gains in productivity. Were it not for the crisis, we would certainly not be in the position we are in today. Climate protection, too, is being spurred on more vigourously. Energy prices in Germany and elsewhere have already risen perceptibly. And in order to attain the ambitious climate goals, carbon prices will have to increase further in the future, thereby presumably pushing up inflation. Governments are actively supporting this transition. As the central bank for the euro area we especially welcome the fiscal policy response at EU level. For the first time since the outbreak of the global financial crisis of 2008, our monetary policy measures are being adequately supported by fiscal policy at the European level. “Next Generation EU” is the largest fiscal package that has ever been financed from the EU budget. The countries that were hardest-hit by the pandemic are receiving extensive financial support to accelerate their recovery. Financial support is not solely about cushioning the economic and social effects of the crisis. The main aim is to strengthen the growth potential of euro area countries by investing in green and digital technologies – in other words, to counteract the forces that brought about the noticeable decline in interest rates over the past decades. That will not only benefit the countries that are receiving the largest share of transfers and loans, but also countries such as Germany that are strongly dependent on exports. Germany can only be strong if Europe is strong. Fiscal and structural policies that are tailored to the euro area strengthen domestic demand, safeguard jobs and prosperity and − by promoting convergence in the euro area − ensure that the single monetary policy can be equally geared to the needs of all euro area countries. Remember that the ECB determines monetary policy not only for Germany, but for the whole currency area. That is laid down in the European Treaties. This aspect is often forgotten in the public debate on German inflation rates. And while core inflation is now rising in Germany, it remains negative in other countries, such as Greece. As long as such a divergence in the euro area remains, the single monetary policy is in danger of having different effects in different countries. “Next Generation EU” has the potential to change that. It can lay the foundation for more convergence and for a durably higher growth path. The quicker and more sustainably this process is advanced, the more rapidly we will exit the low interest rate environment. Optimism boosts demand The third and closely related point that gives reason to hope that we could reach our inflation target sooner than expected is related to people’s expectations. The mood in financial markets is changing. Although medium to long-term inflation expectations are still below 2% – and so do not point to noticeably higher inflation on a durable basis – they are slowly but surely approaching our target (Slide 6). They are closer to 2% than they have been for years. People are now expecting stronger price developments too, which could foster future wage dynamics. Before the pandemic around a third of people in the euro area still expected that prices would increase more slowly, or not at all – and that at a time when inflation was already historically low. And yet surveys show that, despite higher inflation expectations, people in the euro area are no less optimistic about the future. Their purchasing intentions have increased since the start of the year, and their assessment of their financial situation is just as good as it was before the crisis. That can also be attributed to the savings that many people accumulated during the lockdowns, through being forced to forgo consumption and through government support measures. According to ECB estimates, households in the euro area have amassed more than €500 billon in extra savings, over and above the normal saving rate. This represents just over 7% of annual disposable income – an enormous sum. That is certainly good news for firms and the economy. In the foreseeable future, private and public demand will be well above the average of the pre-pandemic years. Increasing turnover and productivity gains on the back of growing digitalisation create scope for new investments, jobs and wage increases, which can in turn sustainably strengthen demand. So if we succeed in breaking the vicious circle of limited room for price increases, slow growth and declining inflation expectations, then we will be able to escape negative interest rates. There are mounting signs that the current fiscal and monetary policy mix can achieve that. From today’s perspective, it is hard to predict how quickly it will come about. Our forward guidance ensures that we won’t respond hastily to rising inflation rates. We will only start the normalisation process when we are confident of reliably reaching our inflation target. But should inflation sustainably reach our target of 2% unexpectedly soon, we will act equally quickly and resolutely. Concluding remarks I would now like to conclude. Today, against the background of rising inflation rates, particularly in Germany, it was a matter of concern to me to alleviate people’s concern that inflation may remain persistently too high or even shoot up uncontrollably. In all likelihood, inflation will noticeably decrease as soon as next year. I have shown that, in view of the extremely low level of inflation last year, the current inflation rates should be interpreted with caution. The picture that is emerging over the entire pandemic differs from the one drawn by some inflation prophets in the public arena. Over the past two years, people in the euro area have on average lost less purchasing power than on average over the last 20 years. The ECB will continue to resolutely safeguard price stability in the euro area. We will vehemently counter persistent upward and downward deviations from our inflation target. We will take the prices of owner-occupied housing into account in inflation measurement. And we will act carefully and cautiously in the current environment in order to finally pave the way out of the low interest rate environment after so many years. Many thanks for your attention.

Some, such as the Bundesbank and the Swiss National Bank, were already committed to using monetary measures to control inflation. But others, such as the Federal Reserve and various European central banks, remained more pessimistic in their outlook, believing that monetary policy was an inefficient means to tame inflation and that other policies should be better employed.[2] Illustrating this view, Fed Chairman William Miller observed in his first FOMC meeting in March 1978 that “inflation is going to be left to the Federal Reserve and that’s going to be bad news. An effective program to reduce the rate of inflation has to extend beyond monetary policy and needs to be complemented by programs designed to enhance competition and to correct structural problems”. [3] In this context of timidity about the effectiveness of policy, inflation expectations were allowed to de-anchor, opening the door to bouts of double-digit price rises. The outcome was a phase of so-called “stagflation”, where both inflation and unemployment rose in tandem. The policy lesson that emerged from this period was that sustainable growth could not be separated from price stability, and that price stability in turn depended on a credible and committed monetary policy. From late 1979 onwards – with Volcker’s assumption of the Fed chairmanship – central banks converged towards this orientation and took ownership for fulfilling their inflation mandates. As their renewed commitment to control inflation became understood, inflation rates fell steeply in a context of improved anchoring of inflation expectations. Central banks abandoned the self-absolving notion that price stability depended on other, non-monetary authorities. As is well-known, the events that led to the 2008 crash confirmed that price stability is not a sufficient condition for macroeconomic stability. Yet it remains a necessary condition. And today in the euro area we face a situation where price stability is once more under threat – this time not through too high inflation, but through inflation remaining too low for too long. In that context, the ECB has been engaged in an unprecedented expansion of its monetary policy toolkit to bring inflation back to its objective. Yet these measures have not been uncontroversial, and questions have been raised about their necessity. What I would like to talk about today, therefore, is not so much what the ECB has done, or how it works, but why the ECB has been so determined to raise inflation. That requires that we first take a closer look at the ECB’s objective. The ECB’s objective The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishes the ECB’s primary objective as maintaining price stability. But unlike some other central banks, we have not been given a specific numerical inflation target by a legislature or ministry. To enhance accountability, in 1998 the ECB Governing Council decided that price stability should be defined in quantitative terms, as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%, and that it should be maintained over the medium-term. Following a thorough evaluation of its monetary policy strategy in 2003, the Governing Council further clarified that, within this definition of price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates “below, but close to, 2% over the medium-term”. In other words, since that clarification in 2003 the numerical range for the definition of price stability has been supplemented with a focal point at which the Governing Council aims, while the temporal horizon over which price stability has to be achieved has remained flexible. However, as inflation has consistently been ratcheting down to the bottom of the price stability range in the course of the past four years and our measures, as a consequence, have become more expansionary, how we interpret our objective and the relevant horizon for delivery have been called more into question. There have been two main issues raised. First, some have asked if the central bank should not be even more patient in trying to bring inflation back to levels in the proximity of the upper ceiling of the price stability range. In this line of thinking, low inflation today is predominantly being driven by global factors which will ultimately unwind if given sufficient time to work through the economy. Due to inertia in the wage and price formation process, there is no particular risk of bouts of very low or even negative inflation feeding into sustained deflation. The central bank should therefore emphasise its medium-term orientation and extend the policy horizon until inflation returns to the desired level. Second, others have queried whether it is justified for the ECB to be so attached to its focal point of below but close to 2% at all. Any rate of inflation between 0% and 2% would be equally consistent with our price stability definition, this argument goes. Indeed, when inflation is at the lower end of the range and conventional policy tools are close to exhausted, the costs of using unconventional measures to drive inflation up outweigh the benefits in terms of preparing the ground for higher inflation in a not so distant future. The central bank should thus not be obsessive about delivering on its aim of a close to 2% inflation rate. Let me address each of these issues in turn. How patient can a central bank be? On the face of it, the argument that central banks can tolerate periods of too-low inflation is correct. Inflation can move temporarily below – or above – our aim without requiring an immediate policy response. That is the implication of our medium-term orientation, which gives the central bank discretion over whether to react to short-run macroeconomic fluctuations. Yet that discretion is always bounded by two factors: the nature of the shocks hitting the economy; and the credibility of our objective in the face of those shocks. If the economy has been hit predominantly by demand shocks, there is no case for the central bank to delay policy action. Both economic activity and inflation will tend to move in the same direction, presenting the central bank with an unambiguous policy prescription, which is to make its monetary policy more accommodative for a negative shock, and less accommodative for a positive one. The medium-term in this case is the shortest period in which we can realistically bring inflation back to our objective, which is equal to the length of the monetary transmission lag. However, if inflation developments are being driven by supply shocks – say, a supply-side induced decline in oil prices – the policy horizon can be more flexible. As activity and inflation move in opposite directions, if the central bank acts to counter fluctuations in prices, it risks exacerbating deviations from steady state output growth. But if instead we extend the medium-term horizon and tolerate lower inflation for a temporary period, there is no contradiction: we can “look through” the shock and wait until its effect on inflation fades out. Crucially, however, our ability to lengthen the medium-term horizon in this way depends on our objective remaining credible – and especially when the economy is hit by repeated one-side shocks and inflation deviates from our objective systematically in the same direction for a prolonged period. In such circumstances, the inflation process can become subject to short-term spells of inertial drift.[4] But if agents remain confident that below but close 2% remains the orientation of policy, they will not factor in past developments into their forward-looking price- and wage-setting behaviour, and inflation will return to our objective in the steady state. If on the other hand the determination to reach our inflation aim were to be questioned by the public, firms and households might start to look more at the track record of recent inflation and incorporate that in their behaviour – which technically would correspond to a permanent downward displacement of the Phillips curve. What began as a temporary period of low inflation could then become persistent. In other words, if in a prolonged period of low inflation the central bank is so tolerant with its policy that the public loses faith in its ultimate inflation objective, it risks not just that expectations destabilise from its aim, but that the economy settles into a new regime of lower inflation, with both inflation and inflation expectations re-anchoring towards the lower end of its price stability range. Faced with such a risk, the policy horizon would immediately have to be shortened to re-establish our commitment and ensure that any outbreak of adaptive expectations was transient. [5] So is this relevant for the euro area today? Certainly, we have faced a succession of one-side global supply shocks since early 2013, and, with tangible intensity, since summer 2014 linked to the reversal of the commodities supercycle. This requires flexibility over the policy horizon. In line with the rule-book that I just expounded, the ECB response was indeed measured in the early phase of rapid disinflation. Except for our announcement of forward guidance in the summer 2013 and a restriction of the monetary policy corridor in November of that year – both measures intended to insulate our money market conditions from the volatility introduced by the dollar tantrum episode in late spring of that same year – our policy rates and non-standard measures were left unaltered until June 2014. We acknowledged that, in conditions of slow recovery, the unwinding of the previous strong contributions of energy prices to headline inflation would counsel patience. Yet, as the recovery proved more subdued and vulnerable to outside shocks than we had expected, and the descent of inflation to the lower portion of the price stability range accelerated and became more entrenched, our attention shifted to a wide spectrum of inflation expectations. The risk was that, unlike in previous episodes of sharp oil price reversals, inflation expectations might lose their resilience, due to accumulating evidence that the return of headline inflation to our objective had been repeatedly put back. Indeed, despite a first reduction in the deposit facility rate to a moderate negative level in June 2014, and the simultaneous announcement of a first series of targeted long-term operations designed to unblock the transmission mechanism, during the summer of 2014 long-term inflation expectations started a gradual decline to levels unseen since the start of monetary union. With unabsorbed slack continuing to hold back core inflation, the end point of convergence after the negative supply-side shocks would fade out of measurement remained unclear, as core inflation – not headline inflation – is a good predictor of headline inflation over the medium term.[6] As such, the importance of core inflation in determining long-term inflation expectations also appeared to be increasing. Without further decisive policy action, sized to a scale appropriate to arrest the process, a downward re-anchoring towards a lower inflation rate could not have been ruled out. These considerations led the Governing Council to announce in January 2015 that the private-credit asset purchase programme that had already been decided over the previous summer would be expended in magnitude to include sovereign securities. The programme has been re-scaled and re-designed in December 2015 and in March of this year. The costs of too-low inflation Let me move to the second question about our policy: even if a re-anchoring of expectations around levels in the lower portion of the price stability range were to take place, why is that fundamentally a problem? The answer to this has two parts. First are the costs that come from the level of inflation being too low, both in the steady state and when dealing with the legacies of the crisis. Second are the costs that arise from transitioning between different anchors for inflation, and especially when the original objective is not being fulfilled. In terms of the costs of too-low inflation, there are three main issues, each of which we emphasised when we clarified our objective in 2003. First, in the presence of downward rigidities, delivering an inflation rate closer to 2% than to 0% supports product and labour market functioning. On the product market side, it allows relative prices to adjust more easily across goods and services in response to shifts in aggregate supply and demand, which improves price signalling and resource allocation. At an average inflation rate of 2%, relative prices can realign around that level without producers necessarily needing to cut prices in nominal terms, whereas at lower inflation rates nominal downward rigidities are more likely to bite and hamper the adjustment process. On the labour market side, a 2% inflation rate provides an important margin of adjustment in the face of shocks. When demand falls and nominal wages are sticky rather than downwardly flexible, the unemployment cost is cushioned by the higher general rate of inflation, as this effectively lowers the real wages that firms have to pay. In summary: the idea that nominal wage rigidities may be an insurance mechanism against deflation becoming endemic – just because it mechanically prevents prices from falling – is a partial equilibrium fallacy. In the face of declining prices, wage rigidities shift the burden of adjustment onto the scale of employment, as firms attempt to recover mark-ups which are being eroded by high labour costs measured in inflation-adjusted terms. The higher jobless rate which results from this labour shedding process exacerbates the downward pressure on the general price level and sets the conditions for this process to become self-feeding. Second, following a similar logic, an inflation rate closer to 2% facilitates cross-regional adjustments in relative prices within a monetary union. A higher “nominal bar” allows countries to reduce inflation relative to the euro area average without having to run up against downward rigidities or enter outright deflation. This was an important consideration when the Governing Council first decided to identify the focal point close to 2% within its price stability range. At the time, core economies, such as Germany and France, were seen as being systematically driven towards the floor of the range since other “catching-up” economies, such as Spain, were operating at high inflation rates and therefore pulling up the euro area average. Letting the average increase toward the upper limit of the range would, it was thought, facilitate the workings of those core economies which were adjusting their relative competitiveness position vis-à-vis other members. Today we face similar heterogeneity in country-based inflation, but the positions of the core versus non-core economies have reversed. Several non-core economies have had to undergo large relative price corrections to reverse the intra-area imbalances accumulated in the boom period. At the same time, core economies have systematically operated at lower inflation rates, pulling down the euro area average against which non-core countries have to adjust. In those conditions, ensuring that the “nominal bar” remains in line with our objective is essential to enable a smooth and expedited adjustment process. Indeed, as we remained mired in the legacies of the financial crisis, it is perhaps even more pressing today than it was in the early life of our currency union. Third, an objective closer to 2% provides a crucial “safety margin” for monetary policy against running into the lower bound on policy rates, and thus provides more scope to use conventional instruments, rather than unconventional and still relatively untested measures, to respond to future shocks. This is because, for a given real interest rate, a higher inflation objective implies a higher nominal interest rate over the cycle. Just as for relative price adjustments, this rationale is also perhaps more important today than when we established our aim. ECB estimates at that time suggested that, with an objective of 2%, the probability of interest rates reaching zero was close to zero .[7] We know now that this was likely an underestimate. Moreover, we assumed a real equilibrium interest rate of 2% on average, which may well be lower today given the evolution of the secular and cyclical forces since then.[8] In that context, if real rates were to continue their trend decline and inflation were to settle lower as well, nominal interest rates could well be considerably lower over future cycles. The central bank might then have to resort to unconventional measures more frequently to fulfil its mandate. This reveals the implicit trade-off in the argument that central banks should not fight too-low inflation because the unconventional measures required to do so produce more costs than benefits. If central banks did not use such measures to raise inflation today, they would be more likely to have to use them tomorrow, by which time low inflation and sluggish growth would have interacted to cause an even deeper slump. By contrast, by acting decisively to defend our objective now, we ward off more severe macroeconomic imbalances and create the minimal conditions for macroeconomic normalisation, which in turn is a precondition for policy normalisation. The costs of transitioning downwards Alongside the costs of a low inflation regime, there are also costs associated with the transition process itself. Again there are three main issues. The first is the impact of unexpectedly low inflation on real interest rates and debt dynamics. When interest rates have reached zero, a downward re-anchoring of inflation implies rising expected real interest rates. That is very problematic in current conditions since, with the economy still adjusting to pre-crisis investment misallocations, the real equilibrium interest rate is now at very low – possibly negative – levels. A fall in inflation would thus pull short-term real interest rates away from their market clearing levels. Saving and investment imbalances would then have to be resolved in another way, which in a market economy would take place through a fall in income levels, in turn compressing savings. In other words, in the environment we face today, the transition to lower inflation rates would risk the economy adjusting through recession. A parallel drop in inflation and rise in real rates would also complicate the necessary workout of the debt overhang bequeathed by those pre-crisis excesses.[9] Lower-than-expected inflation implies that a higher share of firms’ and households’ income has to be diverted to debt service than was planned when the loan was taken out. That can in turn lead to a redistribution between borrowers and lenders, which may have negative demand effects due to their different propensities to consume and invest. Inflation turning out below expectations also more generally impedes the process of deleveraging which is required to reduce high debt levels. Indeed, deleveraging can take place through two channels, which are both important: balance sheet deleveraging (i.e. debt repayment and write-offs) and macroeconomic deleveraging (i.e. growth and inflation). While it is sometimes argued that accommodative monetary policy delays the former, it also supports the latter. In fact, those economies where central banks have resorted to such policies earlier and more aggressively are also those that are most advanced with deleveraging. The reason is that by generating higher growth and inflation in line with their objectives they have been able to minimise the need for balance sheet deleveraging and the associated credit contraction. That has in turn contributed, in a virtuous circle, to a quicker elimination of slack and stronger nominal growth. To illustrate, nominal GDP growth has contributed around 20 percentage points to both household and corporate debt reduction in the US, and almost 30 percentage points in the UK, compared with just 10 percentage points in the euro area. Second – and more fundamentally – allowing inflation to re-anchor downwards comes with a high risk of credibility losses for the central bank, and especially when the objective is not being met. Such losses create true welfare costs for society, as pointed out in the classical contributions by authors like Kydland and Prescott (1977) or Barro and Gordon (1983).[10] And in the current low inflation environment, it would have similarly adverse implications for our credibility as the admissions by some central bankers in the late 1970s that high inflation was an intractable problem and impervious to monetary policy action. We know from that era how costly this can be for central banks’ ability to deliver long-term price stability. Disavowing the inflation aim in current conditions might also be perceived especially negatively by the public, for instance as revealing expectations of “secular stagnation” and associated weak price pressures. Indeed, Eggertsson and Pugsley (2006) show that, in a fragile post-crisis situation where monetary policy is sustaining the recovery, any perception that the central bank is adopting a greater tolerance towards a future regime of lower inflation can have very negative effects. Looking at the Great Depression period, they argue that the return of the US economy to recession in 1937 resulted from a perception that the Fed had abandoned its commitment to reflation, creating pessimistic expectations of future growth and inflation that fed into both expected and actual deflation. The economy then became caught in an equilibrium of “contractionary beliefs”.[11] Third, once central banks let inflation expectations drift away from their previous anchor and fail to counteract this through forceful policy action, there is no guarantee that expectations will naturally settle at another desirable level. As Orphanides and Williams (2004) show, it is precisely by defending its inflation objective that the central bank facilitates the public in learning how to process the flow of information, and thereby influences the formation of inflation expectations.[12] Without such an orientation, expectations may continue to drift in the same direction, and a re-anchoring of inflation expectations may morph into an outright de-anchoring of inflation expectations with no visible end-point. In such conditions, monetary policy would face an uphill battle to preserve inflation rates compatible with any reasonable definition of price stability. To see this, consider a simple Phillips curve framework that relates inflation to measures of economic slack. Accommodative monetary policy reduces the degree of economic slack and thereby puts upward pressures on inflation – a move of the economy along a given Phillips curve. But when inflation expectations change, this is not the only dynamic pattern taking place. Instead, a change in inflation expectations alters the inflation rate to which the economy will gravitate when it reaches full employment. We can think of a decline in inflation expectations as a downward shift in the Philipps curve, leading to a lower intercept. Clearly, this downward shift in the Phillips curve counteracts the reflationary impact that the accommodative monetary policy intends to achieve via the absorption of economic slack; and the downward impact may, in fact, dominate in certain conditions. In particular, if the relationship between inflation and slack is relatively weak – implying a flat slope of the Phillips curve – a given degree of monetary accommodation is less likely to trigger the upward momentum in prices necessary to compensate for falling inflation expectations. As a consequence, actual inflation may decline, even in situations where monetary policy has been successful in reducing slack. The economy may then enter on a self-sustaining spiral: declining inflation expectations shift down the Phillips curve, which puts downward pressure on actual inflation, which in turn translates into a further decline in inflation expectations. Conclusion Let me conclude. Decades of experience have confirmed the importance of price stability for macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth. That is true both when inflation is too high and when it is too low. The prolonged period of low inflation we are in today has increased the risks that inflation misses might become persistent, which would be deeply damaging for the economy. This is why we have reacted so forcefully to secure our objective – and will continue to do so in the future if necessary. To be sure, the crisis has proven that ensuring price stability is not sufficient for sustainable growth. It is only an enabling condition and other policies must also play their part. Still, the need for a superior policy mix is no excuse for central banks to be passive when their mandates are under threat. The ECB has demonstrated through its actions that it does not wait for others to move first.

To be able to deliver on their mandates, monetary policymakers must understand its root causes, dynamics as well as possible knock-on effects. My comments today will focus on the current inflationary environment in the euro area and the ECB’s monetary policy response. I will start by giving you a brief overview of how we got to where we are today and how we see the outlook for growth and inflation developing over the coming years. I will then take a more in-depth look at the main drivers of inflation, focusing on how they have evolved over the course of the pandemic and more recently. Finally, I will turn to the ECB’s monetary policy response so far. The outlook for inflation and growth in the euro area At the onset of the current inflation surge, the euro area economy was hit by a succession of extraordinary adverse supply shocks which pushed inflation far above the ECB’s 2% medium-term target. The COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 led to the enforced closure of large parts of the economy and a sharp drop in activity levels and inflation. As the consumer goods industry reopened and consumption patterns shifted from contact-intensive services to goods, supply and demand mismatches emerged. Bottlenecks slowed the supply of key intermediate inputs.[2] The decisive monetary and fiscal support measures that were put in place during the early stages of the pandemic protected people’s livelihoods, offered support to households and firms and counteracted the deflationary impact of the pandemic during the second half of 2020 and in the first half of 2021. Then came Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Europe’s dependence on gas and food imports from the region led to an acute energy crisis and a significant negative terms-of-trade shock. Since then Europe has managed to reduce its dependence on Russian gas and avoided both energy rationing and a sharp contraction in activity. The gradual reversal of this shock is supporting economic growth and slowly reducing price pressures. But as the war is still ongoing, the risk of further upward pressure on commodity prices remains. The recovery in demand, combined with supply disruptions, has made it easier for firms to pass on high input costs to consumer prices and for workers to negotiate higher wages.[3] This increases the risk of significant second-round effects. The euro area economy has broadly stagnated in recent quarters as high prices and tighter financing conditions have weighed on household spending and private investment. Manufacturing activity has been hit particularly hard, while the services sector continues to benefit from the momentum generated from the reopening of the economy. The labour market, meanwhile, has remained resilient. Almost 3.5 million jobs have been added since the start of 2022, largely thanks to an expanding labour force, with unemployment registering historical lows during the past year and reaching 6.5% in May 2023. Although still too high, inflation fell from its peak of 10.6% in October last year, initially driven by a drop in energy inflation, to 5.5% in June, according to the Eurostat’s flash estimate. Inflation excluding energy and food – often referred to as core inflation – has been more persistent. It started to moderate only recently, declining to 5.3% in May, but it is estimated to have ticked up slightly to 5.4% in June. In June, Eurosystem staff revised down slightly the outlook for growth in the euro area for the next two years. The economy is expected to slow to 0.9% in 2023 before rebounding to 1.5% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025 as energy prices moderate, foreign demand strengthens and real incomes improve. At the same time, the ECB’s monetary policy tightening is increasingly feeding through to the real economy while fiscal support is gradually withdrawn. Inflation is projected to continue to slow as energy prices fall, food inflation moderates and supply bottlenecks ease. Eurosystem staff now see headline inflation decreasing from 8.4% in 2022 to 5.4% in 2023, 3.0% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. At the same time, underlying price pressures remain strong. Staff have revised up their projections for inflation excluding energy and food, owing to past upward surprises and the implications of a robust labour market for the speed of disinflation. They now see it reaching 5.1% on average in 2023 before declining to 3.0% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025. The anatomy of inflation The drivers of inflation today are very different in type and magnitude from those in play before the pandemic as could be suspected in view of the recent unprecedentedly high inflation rates.[4] Energy prices have been the most important driver of both the previous surge and the current decline in inflation. Recovering global demand drove the initial rise in commodity prices over the course of 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 pushed up commodity prices further, leading to an energy inflation rate of 44.3% year on year in March 2022, unprecedented in euro area history. Food inflation was also affected; it reached a historic high of 15.5% in March of this year. These developments have hit lower income households particularly hard owing to the significant share of energy and food in their consumption basket. During the pandemic, the rotation of consumption away from services towards goods, combined with supply bottlenecks, resulted in severe demand-supply mismatches. This set in motion an inflationary impulse which pushed durable goods inflation to historically high levels.[5] More recently, goods inflation fell to 5.5% in June from its peak of 6.8% in February 2023. This reflects the easing of global supply shocks, as well as the impact of our monetary policy tightening on interest-sensitive components of demand, such as durable goods consumption. Although services inflation eased slightly in May, it has been on an upward trajectory since mid-2021, reaching 5.4% in June.[6] The persistence in services inflation reflects that some cost pressures and reopening effects are still passing through. At the same time, rising wages are adding inflationary pressure to labour-intensive services. The reopening of the economy after the pandemic resulted in a strong resurgence of pent-up demand for contact-intensive services in particular, such as restaurants and travel related-items. Overall, the pass-through from the recent supply shocks to underlying prices has been faster and more widespread than before the pandemic. This likely reflects both the unprecedented size and duration of the shocks which, combined with economic dislocations and significant labour shortages, allowed firms to pass higher input costs on to consumers. In an attempt to rebuild purchasing power, workers continue to push for higher wages.[7] Given these unprecedented economic shocks, projecting key macroeconomic variables has proven challenging. This is particularly true for headline inflation, which has seen significant forecast errors by major professional forecasters, central banks and policy institutions since the start of the pandemic. Disentangling the “signal” on headline inflation from the “noise” has become increasingly difficult.[8] Underlying inflation measures have therefore become an important pillar in assessing the inflation outlook and risks.[9] These measures aim to capture more persistent price developments (for instance, by excluding more volatile items from headline inflation) to provide a clearer signal for medium-term inflation developments. However, a key challenge is that the standard set of measures of underlying inflation continue to be contaminated by past energy shocks, supply disruptions and reopening dynamics. Since the start of the pandemic, the accuracy of both headline and core inflation projections one or two years ahead has in fact deteriorated significantly. Each indicator has its advantages and disadvantages and the performance of different measures can change over time. It is therefore important to monitor a wide range of indicators of underlying inflation.[10] That said, there are currently two clear messages. First, while underlying price pressures remain strong, most indicators have started to show some signs of softening. Second, while still wide by historical standards, the range of measures of underlying inflation recently began to narrow. This suggests that the unusually high level of uncertainty around the downward trajectory of inflation over the medium term has started to ease somewhat. A closer look at some of these indicators however, reveals that some are levelling off only recently. As the indirect effects of past energy price shocks and other pipeline price pressures gradually fade, labour costs – an important component of prices in the services sector – are becoming a dominant driver of inflation. Wage pressures are rising and we have factored strong wage growth into our inflation projections. Compensation per employee rose by 5.2% year on year in the first quarter of 2023 and is expected to continue to grow strongly in the coming months. At the same time, firms in some sectors (such as trade, transport, accommodation and food) increased their profits, especially where demand outstripped supply.[11] Looking ahead, this may offer firms room to absorb the impact of wage increases on prices as other input costs moderate. The June 2023 Eurosystem staff projections assume a downward trajectory for firms’ profit margins along these lines. Given the crucial role of labour costs in the outlook, we are closely monitoring inflation dynamics in the services sector where these costs play a particularly important role. The ECB’s monetary policy response In response to the extraordinary surge in inflation since 2021, the ECB began to considerably tighten its monetary policy stance in several phases to make sure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. In December 2021 we announced that we would start normalising monetary policy by reducing the pace of net asset purchases. We decided to end net purchases in the first half of 2022, first under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and then under the asset purchase programme (APP). In July 2022 we began raising the key ECB interest rates, and we have since raised the deposit facility rate by a cumulative 400 basis points to 3.5%. Finally, to support the overall monetary policy stance, the Governing Council started to reduce the APP portfolio in March by only partially replacing maturing securities held therein, and reinvestments under the programme were discontinued as of this month. We expect the transmission of our monetary policy tightening to operate across the entire yield curve.[12] The recent increases in policy rates affect the very short-term money market rates directly, while expectations of future policy rate changes lead to rising medium to long-term interest rates. At the same time, the rundown of our securities portfolio and changes in expectations of our holdings also push up long-term yields by increasing the duration risk that investors must hold. Due to these higher interest rates, households are expected to save more and consume less, while firms tend to reduce investments. Together, these effects lead to a cooling in aggregate demand that eventually feeds into lower inflation. The bulk of the impact of our tightening is expected to materialise only in the course of this year and thereafter. Model estimates by ECB staff suggest that, owing to the tightening, inflation in 2022 was only half a percentage point lower than it would have otherwise been, while the downward impact is expected to average two percentage points over the period 2023-25.[13] These model-based estimates provide a useful benchmark for assessing the strength of monetary policy transmission. However, during periods of elevated uncertainty or when policy is tightened quickly, transmission may differ in ways that are difficult to capture using models based on historical regularities. There may also be important non-linear dynamics – such as risks of inflation expectations becoming de-anchored or risks of financial effects being propagated more forcefully – that are not captured by linear models. For these reasons, models must be complemented by real-time monitoring of the transmission of policy to financial variables as well as leading indicators of prices and economic activity. Given the unprecedented nature of the shocks that are working their way through the economy, as well as the uncertainty around the strength and speed of the impact of past rate hikes on inflation, we will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. This data dependence works via the three rate-setting criteria that the Governing Council laid out in March 2023. Our future policy rate decisions will be based on (i) the assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation, and (iii) the strength of monetary policy transmission. It is important to note that these three criteria are equally important and provide cross-checks for the Governing Council in assessing the overall level and duration of restriction that will be necessary to achieve our objective. Our June projections confirmed that, while inflation has moderated, it is expected to remain above our 2% target for too long. Although underlying price pressures are moderating, they remain strong and confirm the upward revision to both headline and core inflation. Nevertheless, the transmission of our unprecedented policy rate hikes so far to tighter financing conditions is well advanced and we are now beginning to see the impact on parts of the real economy. Conclusion To conclude, a succession of unprecedented shocks over the past three years has pushed inflation far above target in the euro area and around much of the world. The ECB’s Governing Council has responded by increasing interest rates substantially and has so far raised the policy rates by 400 basis points since July last year – the fastest tightening on record. But our job is not yet done. Services inflation, and labour costs in particular, need to be closely monitored, as they are now an important driver of overall inflation. The current high inflation environment requires that monetary and fiscal policy work in the same direction. As energy prices fall and risks around the energy supply recede, it is important that the energy-related government support measures are rolled back to prevent that these drive up medium-term inflationary pressures. Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. As the shocks reverse and the effects of our past rate increases are gradually transmitted across the real economy, inflation is projected to decline further towards our target. Nevertheless, the inflation outlook is surrounded by significant uncertainty, and we will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.

Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Inflation: Drivers and Dynamics 2020 Online Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland/European Central Bank, 22 May 2020 In my remarks today, I will discuss some analytical issues in understanding the drivers of international inflation co-movements. In particular, I will examine the individual contributions of common shocks, structural change and the evolution of monetary policy regimes to the observed high correlation of inflation across countries. At the same time, I will caution that correlated inflation paths are not inevitable. Some underlying forces may contribute to divergent inflation outcomes in the years to come. International inflation patterns As illustrated in Chart 1, average rates of inflation have generally declined and exhibited lower volatility in recent decades, most notably in advanced economies.[1] A common component accounts for a large share of the remaining variability of national inflation rates: this finding has been confirmed for advanced economies in a range of studies.[2] Chart 1 Range of inflation in advanced and emerging economies over time (annual percentage changes) Source: Haver Analytics. Note: The interquartile range covers 50% of the sample of 25 advanced and 93 emerging market economies. Although Chart 1 shows high cross-country correlations in headline inflation, Chart 2 indicates that the dynamics differ significantly between headline inflation and core inflation measures that are constructed by stripping out the volatile energy and food components. In fact, as shown in Chart 3, there has been an increase in cross-country correlations for headline inflation since the global financial crisis (left panel), but a decrease for core inflation (right panel).[3] Chart 2 Inflation in the euro area and in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (annual percentage changes) Source: Eurostat and Haver Analytics.

Notes: The data cover 33 advanced and emerging economies at monthly frequency. The pre-crisis sample runs from January 1997 to June 2008 and the post-crisis sample from July 2008 to December 2019. In the rest of my speech, I will examine the role of a range of factors in these correlated inflation outcomes, including the distribution of underlying shocks, structural changes in the world economy and the role of monetary policy regimes. Common shocks One possible explanation for the synchronisation of inflation is that shocks have become more synchronised. Since central banks typically seek to stabilise medium-term inflation and do not neutralise fully the impact of shocks on inflation outcomes, it is plausible that a preponderance of common shocks can account for strong co-movements in the deviations of national inflation rates from their medium-term target levels. Moreover, in a world of low inflation and low interest rates it is plausible that the impact of negative shocks on observed inflation is likely to be more persistent, since the available policy space to quickly offset negative inflation shocks is more constrained. Under these conditions, there may be prolonged deviations of inflation outcomes away from the inflation aim, with central banks closing inflation gaps over a longer time horizon. One source of global fluctuations in inflation is the pronounced volatility of commodity prices.[4] That these play a prominent role in global inflation volatility is not only indicated by Chart 3 but also confirmed by studies that analyse the contributions of the underlying components of overall inflation. International co-movements of inflation are largely related to the dynamics of energy prices and, to a lesser extent, food prices (see Chart 4).[5] Food and energy are the components that are the most correlated across countries. For instance, the fall in oil prices by about 60 percent since December 2019 accounts for the bulk of the 0.9 percentage point drop in headline inflation between then and April 2020 in the euro area. Chart 4 The relation between the common factor in global inflation and commodity price developments (annual percentage changes) Sources: Haver Analytics and national statistical offices.Notes: The common factor is demeaned. The estimation sample runs from January 1997 to December 2019. The blue line reflects the zero mean common factor in global inflation as derived by replicating the principal component approach of Ciccarelli, M. and Mojon, B. (op. cit.) for a sample of 33 advanced and emerging economies. The yellow line reflects movements of oil and food prices weighted with the coefficients derived by a linear regression of the common factor on oil and food prices. The transmission of commodity prices to domestic inflation is, however, neither automatic nor uniform across countries. At the most basic level, the impact of global shocks on domestic inflation depends on factors such as exchange rate movements and the domestic monetary policy regime. For example, it is sometimes neglected that the path for oil prices in US dollars is not the same as the path for oil prices in euro. While the oil price is globally quoted in US dollars, the pattern of movements in the USD/EUR exchange rate has meant that the oil price in euro has been much less volatile than the oil price in US dollars (see Chart 5).[6] This illustrates a general principle: an independent monetary policy (and, as a corollary, a flexible exchange rate) means that there is no deterministic relationship between international relative price movements and overall inflation rates.[7] Chart 5 Oil prices in US dollars and in euro (USD per barrel and EUR per barrel) Sources: ECB and Bloomberg. Structural change and inflation outcomes The structure of the economy matters for wage and price-setting dynamics and the transmission of shocks to the real economy. Two categories of structural change may have contributed to greater co-movement in inflation outcomes. First, structural changes that increase international interdependence mean that a shock in one region may also affect economic performance and inflation outcomes in other regions. Second, structural changes that affect national economies in similar ways mean that there may be a common pattern in observed inflation even if shocks are mainly domestic in origin. In contrast, other types of structural change have the potential to contribute to divergent inflation outcomes across countries. Economic and financial globalisation influences inflation outcomes through several mechanisms.[8],[9] First, through enhanced trade linkages and higher cross-border knowledge flows, economic globalisation may contribute to greater similarity in productivity dynamics across countries. Moreover, closer economic integration through global value chains (GVCs) and the operation of multinational firms are mechanisms that transmit local shocks to other countries and generate more synchronised business cycles. For instance, shifts in demand in one economy can affect demand in upstream economies through trade linkages. This mechanism is confirmed by empirical evidence showing that increased GVC participation is associated with more synchronised inflation dynamics.[10] The degree of GVC integration also helps to explain the contribution of global economic slack to the domestic inflation environment.[11] By one estimate, international input-output linkages account for around half of the global component of producer price inflation.[12] At the same time, it should be recognised that economic globalisation can also be a source of divergent inflationary pressures, especially during adjustment phases. In particular, re-allocation shocks can see some industries expand in some regions, but contract in others, with a particular impact on wage dynamics if there is a shift in the level and composition of labour demand. The contribution of economic globalisation to higher inflation co-movements may also differ between phases in which globalisation acts as an anti-inflationary force and phases in which globalisation acts as pro-inflationary force. As indicated earlier, shocks that push inflation below the target level are more difficult to neutralise than shocks that push inflation above the target level, in view of the asymmetric policy space (the tools to tighten the monetary stance are more effective than the tools to loosen the monetary stance). Over the last quarter century, the dominant contribution of globalisation for advanced economies may have been as an anti-inflationary force (through increased productivity, increased international factor mobility, the entry of labour-abundant countries into the global trading system). However, especially with rising wages and income levels in emerging economies, globalisation may in the future act as a pro-inflationary force. This would also be reinforced if de-globalisation forces (such as protectionism and increasing transportation costs) served to reverse some of the productivity gains achieved in recent decades. Second, to the extent that it is associated with a larger common component in the determination of financial conditions, financial globalisation can also contribute to greater similarity in inflation dynamics. This is most visible during global financial crises, as these are typically associated with significant recessions and disinflationary pressures. However, in the other direction, financial globalisation can also contribute to asymmetric business cycle dynamics. For instance, international financial flows may amplify and prolong the domestic credit cycle, with the banking system obtaining additional leverage on international markets during upswings but suffering more rapid and severe funding outflows during downturns.[13] Moreover, to the extent that financial globalisation facilitates larger and more persistent current account imbalances, this may also contribute to divergent inflation paths between surplus and deficit countries. For instance, there is some suggestive evidence that the persistent current account surplus of the euro area has been a low-frequency contributor to the decline in inflation outcomes over the last decade.[14] Third, international migration flows also affect inflation dynamics. At a macroeconomic level, a higher sensitivity of migration flows to the business cycle can dampen the wage response to employment shocks, with net migration acting as another adjustment margin.[15] The wage-setting process may also be influenced by differences in bargaining power between immigrant and local workers. Similarly, price-setting behaviour in some sectors may be reshaped by differences in search intensities between different groups. In relation to the second category of structural changes, trends such as population ageing and digitalisation are broadly similar across advanced economies.[16] In addition to the impact of these trends on aggregate and sectoral economic activity, these forces may also affect price and wage-setting behaviour and alter the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Population ageing operates through multiple channels. As well as having an impact on aggregate output growth (both through shrinking labour force participation and productivity dynamics), the current phase of population ageing is contributing to the trend decline in the underlying equilibrium real interest rate.[17] In turn, as indicated in the introduction, a low interest rate environment means that negative shocks affect inflation outcomes more persistently. Moreover, demographic patterns influence consumption patterns, altering the composition of the overall price index, and shape the responsiveness of consumption to monetary policy actions.[18] In addition to the general impact of digitalisation on the structure of the domestic and international economies, it is also re-shaping pricing behaviour in many sectors, through the impact of online distribution channels and the automation of pricing decisions based on the information that is contained in real-time datasets.[19] Such digital pricing algorithms may increase increasing the responsiveness of prices to shocks.[20] This effect is likely to extend beyond actual online sales, since online prices also constrain brick-and-mortar prices.[21] Digitalisation may also give rise to the emergence of “superstar firms” that assume a dominant market position (thanks to the combination of high fixed and low variable costs that is prevalent in many digital markets), which may also have a substantial impact on pricing behaviour. These complement changes in market power and market structures that go beyond digitalisation.[22] While available estimates point to digitalisation having had only a small impact on aggregate price dynamics, the effects may become larger as digitalisation becomes more pervasive. So far, the steady-state impact of digitalisation on market structures and pricing dynamics remains quite uncertain. For example, while 43 percent of respondents to a survey on price setting in the United Kingdom cited increased competition as a reason for increasing the frequency of price setting over the previous decade, 42 percent cited it as a reason for reducing the frequency.[23], [24] Finally, it is important to recognise that some structural trends can contribute to divergent inflation outcomes. Most obviously, the trend increase in the share of services in economic activity in high-income economies means that core inflation will be increasingly determined by domestic factors, given that services are less tradable than manufacturing (see Chart 6).[25] Chart 6 Share of services in core inflation in the euro area (percentages) Sources: Eurostat. Note: Core inflation refers to HICP excluding energy and food. In a similar vein, the declining share of energy in the production functions and consumption baskets of advanced economies means that the importance of common energy shocks for domestic inflation rates is diminishing, both through a lower direct impact of fluctuations in commodity prices on headline inflation and the weakening of second-round effects.[26] The structure of the international monetary system may also contribute to divergent inflation outcomes. For instance, there is a sharp distinction between the major issuers of international reserve currencies and other countries. For the former, exports and imports are typically priced in domestic currency, so short-term exchange rate volatility has a much more limited impact on inflation outcomes in those countries than in countries in which exports and imports are typically priced in foreign currencies, with a dominant global role for US dollar pricing.[27] In addition, the latter countries are also more exposed to the global financial cycle owing to the limited capacity of such countries to insulate themselves from international funding shocks. Monetary policy regimes The convergence in monetary policy regimes across countries has played a central role in the convergence in medium-term inflation outcomes. Almost all major advanced economies now have an inflation aim in the region of two percent, whether formally instituted as a policy target or as a longer-term goal.[28] In turn, lower and less-volatile overall inflation is associated with a higher global component in the short-term inflation volatility that remains, especially for countries with more independent central banks.[29] The impact of a commodity price shock on inflation provides a good illustration of the difference between the initial impact and the longer-term impact of a shock. As discussed earlier, commodity price volatility is a common source of headline inflation volatility around the world. However, the impact of a commodity price shock on domestic inflation is neutralised over time, with the monetary policy stance adjusted as required to ensure convergence to the medium-term domestic inflation target.[30] In addition, the anchor provided by the medium-term inflation target means that such shocks are less likely to permeate through second-round effects. The challenge for central banks is to ensure that monetary policy strategies successfully protect the medium-term inflation aim by ensuring that the economic and financial assessments that inform policy decisions successfully diagnose the nature of the underlying shocks driving the inflation outlook. This includes recognising the impact of trend forces such as globalisation, demography and digitalisation (together with climate change and the pandemic) on the underlying structure of the economy and the dynamics of wage and price setting. In making these assessments on an ongoing basis, it is important to avoid the temptation to extrapolate from recent experience; in particular, some of the forces that have contributed to an increase in international inflation co-movement in recent decades may act as sources of divergence in the future. These strategic challenges are especially acute under conditions of low inflation and low interest rates, since deviations from the medium-term inflation aim are likely to be more persistent under such conditions. Accordingly, our monetary policy strategy review – even if it is unavoidably delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic – remains a high priority for the ECB.

The model of an independent central bank commited to a clear inflation aim had spread much more widely among advanced economies than among emerging and developing countries. However, more recently, as this model has become more widespread, both average inflation and inflation volatility have declined in a wider range of economies.

As inflation rose, we were confronted with profound uncertainty about how far it would go and how widely it would spread across the economy. And even as inflation has eased, uncertainty about its persistence has remained. The potential costs of mis-calibrating policy have been high, which is why we had to employ a policy framework that minimises the risk of mistakes. And we have done so by building our reaction function around three criteria: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission. Though we conceived these criteria when we had low visibility of future inflation, they have also helped guide our decisions as inflation has fallen and forecasts have become more accurate. As Marie Curie once said, to thrive through the ups and down of life, “we must have perseverance and above all confidence”. And our framework has indeed encouraged us to persevere when necessary and to build up confidence when needed. It has served as a reliable compass for calibrating policy through three phases of our current policy cycle. First, it helped create robustness during our tightening phase when we were devising how far we needed to go to rein in inflation. Second, it has helped us practice patience during the holding phase until the signals from our inflation projections and underlying inflation are more consistent. Third, it will support us in building up sufficient confidence to begin the dialling-back phase in which we make policy less restrictive. The tightening phase In the early phase of our tightening cycle, our main priority amid surging inflation rates was to exit our accommodative policy stance as quickly as possible. While the policy challenge was immense, the policy path was relatively simple to calibrate. But as rates rose and approached restrictive territory, calibrating our policy stance became more complex. We first had to assess how much rates needed to rise until they were sufficiently restrictive, and then for how long they needed to stay at that level. But our assessment was blurred by much lower than normal visibility of the future. Our forecasts repeatedly underpredicted inflation by large margins, even at shorter horizons. From 2021 to 2022 for example, the absolute inflation forecast errors in the staff macroeconomic projections, one quarter ahead, more than doubled, largely owing to volatile energy prices.[1] At the same time, the mix of shocks that emerged from the pandemic and its aftermath – rotations in spending, energy spikes, “bullwhip” cycles in manufacturing, supply bottlenecks, tight labour markets, fiscal expansion and reopening effects – heightened the risk of inflation becoming more persistent. We faced a highly unusual conjuncture of high inflation and declining real wages, but also rising employment. This combination essentially implied a multi-year catch-up process to make up for real wage losses. In turn, this process could have triggered what I referred to at last year’s conference as a “tit-for-tat” inflation dynamic.[2] And we faced uncertainty as to how quickly and forcefully our monetary policy response would succeed in bringing down inflation. The ECB had not been through a tightening cycle for more than a decade, and there were reasons to believe that the transmission of monetary policy to firms and households might have changed.[3] So, to calibrate policy accurately, we needed a framework for policy decisions that would work when we had low visibility and would mitigate heightened uncertainty. This is why we built our monetary policy response around the three criteria I referred to earlier: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission. This approach made our decisions more robust, as the inflation path we foresaw in our projections had to be validated by data we could observe in real time and extrapolate into the medium term. That, in turn, enabled us to take forward-looking decisions with a higher degree of confidence. And it served us well in practice. The three criteria helped us to map out the remaining climb, allowing us to bring rates to sufficiently restrictive levels to break the persistence of inflation.[4] But also, by guiding us to carefully evaluate the strength of policy transmission, they acted as a cross-check against overtightening. This helped us reach the decision to stop rate hikes after last September. The holding phase We then entered the current phase of our policy cycle – the holding phase – during which we committed to keep rates at restrictive levels for as long as necessary. Since the start of this phase, inflation has been declining consistently and our projections have been showing inflation returning to our target over the medium term. We now project inflation to average 2.3% in 2024, which is 0.4 percentage points less than projected in December and 0.9 percentage points less than September. We then expect inflation to decline to 2.0% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. And unlike in the earlier phases of our policy cycle, there are reasons to believe that the expected disinflationary path will continue. First, for some time now inflation outturns have been broadly in line with our expectations. In 2023 we saw a reduction of about 70% in the average absolute error in our staff projections relative to 2022, one quarter ahead. Second, we now see inflation returning to 2% earlier in our projection horizon than before, in mid-2025, and not exceeding our target for the remainder of the horizon. Third, the composition of inflation is improving, as we now expect lower core inflation in the medium term. This suggests that the convergence to 2% is likely to be more durable and less beholden to assumptions about commodity prices, although the latter can always prove hazardous. The other criteria are also becoming more consistent with this improved inflation outlook. The transmission of our monetary policy is unfolding in the right direction. Financing conditions have reacted strongly to higher rates, loan demand has weakened and, in turn, activity has slowed notably in the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. And underlying inflation is generally easing. Nearly all the measures that we track are declining, and the range of readings between the different measures has narrowed from 4.1 percentage points at its peak to 2.4 percentage points today. Some of the measures of underlying inflation with the best leading indicator properties for future inflation have dropped steeply.[5] But, at the same time, domestic price pressures remain strong. Services inflation is still stubborn and hovering around 4%, while momentum increased somewhat in February. And our indicator of domestic inflation, which measures items with a low import content, stands at 4.5%, at the top of the range of underlying inflation measures that we monitor. This measure has also been found to have good leading indicator properties.[6] These pressures largely reflect robust wage growth as the catch-up process continues, as well as a tight labour market that has so far been resilient to a slowing economy. Employment grew by two million cumulatively during 2023, even as the economy stagnated, while firms continue to hoard labour. This pattern is mechanically lowering labour productivity and pushing up unit labour costs. At this stage, it is difficult to assess whether these price pressures simply reflect the lag in wages and services prices and the procyclical nature of productivity, or whether they signal persistent inflationary pressures. So, although we have made significant progress in all three of our framework criteria, we are not yet sufficiently confident that we are on a sustainable path towards our inflation target. Building sufficient confidence to dial back policy So the essential question is: what do we need to see to become sufficiently confident to start dialling back our restrictive policy stance? Put simply, we need to move further along the disinflationary path. And there are three domestic factors that will be decisive to ensuring that the inflation path evolves as we project. The first of these is wage growth. Our forecast sees nominal wages slowing to 3% over the next three years, allowing real wages to fully catch up to pre-pandemic levels over the projection horizon, also including productivity gains.[7] But with the unemployment rate expected to remain very low at 6.6%, this wage path cannot be taken for granted. Sensitivity analysis by ECB staff shows that if there were an earlier full catch-up by the end of this year, inflation would rise to 3% in 2025 and only fall to 2.5% in 2026.[8] The second is profit margins. The compression of profit margins has allowed wages to catch up without further accelerating inflation. Unit profits accounted for more than 50% of the GDP deflator in the last quarter of 2022 but this figure fell to just 20% a year later. But our sensitivity analysis shows that, if firms were to regain pricing power as the economy recovers and profit margins were to rise by an accumulated 1 percentage point more than we project until the end of 2026, inflation would be 2.7% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026. The third factor is productivity growth. We expect that a pick-up in demand, if accommodated by fully utilising hoarded labour, will lead to rising productivity growth and falling unit labour costs. We project labour productivity growth of 0.1% this year before it rises to 1.2% in 2025 and 2026. But the path of inflation could be different if, in a new geopolitical environment, productivity losses for European firms turn out to be partly structural. Given the delays with which these data become available, we cannot wait until we have all the relevant information. To do so could risk being too late in adjusting policy. But in the coming months, we expect to have two important pieces of evidence that could raise our confidence level sufficiently for a first policy move. First, we will have more data to confirm whether wages are indeed growing in a way that is compatible with inflation reaching our target sustainably by mid-2025. The latest data point in this direction. Growth in compensation per employee edged down to 4.6% in the fourth quarter of last year – slightly below our March projection – from 5.1% in the third quarter. Negotiated wage growth, which accounts for the lion’s share of compensation per employee growth, also decreased from 4.7% to 4.5% in the fourth quarter. Similarly, the ECB’s forward-looking wage tracker, which anticipates the development of negotiated wage growth in the euro area, is showing early signs that pressure is easing. Average wage growth in 2024 for all existing wage contracts[9] fell from 4.4% at the time of our January Governing Council meeting to 4.2% at the time of our meeting in March. The coming months will help us form an even clearer picture. We will receive data on negotiated wage growth in the first quarter of this year at the end of May. And many wage negotiations are currently taking place in large sectors, the outcome of which will be entered into our wage tracker as soon as the negotiations are concluded. Employees whose contracts ran out last year and have not been renewed, or will run out by March 2024, account for around one-third of those in our wage tracker. Second, by June we will have a new set of projections that will confirm whether the inflation path we foresaw in our March forecast remains valid. These projections will also implicitly give us more insight into the path of underlying inflation. We will have more visibility on the strength of the recovery and the likely direction of the labour market, and therefore on the consequences for wages, profits and productivity. In addition, we will have had a longer window to assess whether inflation data continue to fall broadly in line with our projections. If they do, we can be more confident that our models are now better accurately capturing inflation dynamics. And this confirmation will be particularly important for the more persistent components, such as services, so that we can trust these components will continue to decline in keeping with their typical lagging pattern. If these data reveal a sufficient degree of alignment between the path of underlying inflation and our projections, and assuming transmission remains strong, we will be able to move into the dialling back phase of our policy cycle and make policy less restrictive. But thereafter, domestic price pressures will still be visible. We expect services inflation, for example, to remain elevated for most of this year. So, there will be a period ahead where we need to confirm on an ongoing basis that the incoming data supports our inflation outlook. This has two important implications for the policy path ahead. First, our decisions will have to remain data dependent and meeting-by-meeting, responding to new information as it comes in. This implies that, even after the first rate cut, we cannot pre-commit to a particular rate path. Second, our policy framework will remain important to process the incoming data and calibrate the appropriate policy stance. At the same time, the relative weights assigned to the three criteria will have to be regularly examined. Conclusion Let me conclude. I said after our last Governing Council meeting that, when it comes to the data that is relevant for our policy decisions, we will know a bit more by April and a lot more by June. I hope that my remarks today help you to better understand our analysis and logic. In the coming months, we will receive more data, which will help us to assess whether we are sufficiently confident in the path ahead to move to the next phase of our policy cycle.

Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Inflation: Drivers and Dynamics Conference 2024 organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the ECB Cleveland, 24 October 2024 Introduction My aim today is to provide an update on underlying inflation in the euro area.[1] The concept of underlying inflation plays a central role in the conduct of the ECB’s monetary policy: our interest rate decisions are based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. This three-pronged reaction function complements the traditional focus on the inflation forecast for inflation-targeting central banks with the signals embodied in underlying inflation measures, while also incorporating the evolving evidence on the strength of monetary policy transmission in the calibration of the monetary stance. This pragmatic approach reflects the value of data dependence under highly atypical macroeconomic conditions. Latest developments in euro area underlying inflation Underlying inflation is the persistent component of inflation, signalling where headline inflation will settle in the medium term after temporary factors have vanished. In practice, underlying inflation is unobservable and needs to be proxied or estimated. There are two broad categories of measures that aim to capture this concept. Exclusion-based measures omit certain items – such as energy and food – that are typically volatile and more sensitive to global factors than domestic fundamentals. Model-based measures, meanwhile, capture more complex channels and dynamics, subject to the limitations imposed by sensitivity to model estimation. An overview of such measures is shown in Chart 1. Model-based measures at the ECB include the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI), which is constructed by estimating a dynamic factor model that extracts the persistent and common component of inflation from granular price data at the item-country level, thereby exploiting the relative advantages of both cross-sectional and time series approaches.[2] Another model-based measure is Supercore inflation, which picks out those items that are estimated to co-move with the business cycle. These model-based measures are reduced form in nature and, among other factors, reflect the empirical contribution of monetary policy tightening to delivering disinflation. That is to say, if current inflation is above target, one reason why underlying inflation might run below current inflation is that the projected mean reversion is partly driven by endogenous monetary policy tightening that has historically contributed to the return of inflation to the target over the medium term. In turn, monitoring the evolution of underlying inflation is an important element in diagnosing whether monetary policy is appropriately calibrated. Each of the underlying inflation indicators tracked by the ECB has declined significantly since the post-pandemic inflation surges, with the range narrowing towards its historical average. The majority of indicators are hovering around 1.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent, down from a much wider range between 3.4 per cent to 7.5 per cent at its peak (Chart 1). Core inflation is the most prominent exclusion-based measure, defined as HICP inflation excluding energy and food: this edged down to 2.7 per cent in September, continuing the marked decline from 4.5 per cent a year ago.[3]In terms of model-based measures, the PCCI today is at the bottom of the range, standing at 1.9 per cent in September and having hovered around 2.0 per cent since the end of last year. Most other measures that we regularly monitor have also come down over the past year and show signs of continued easing in September. One challenge in interpreting standard indicators of underlying inflation is that these were affected by the past extraordinary supply shocks, as well as by temporary mismatches between demand and supply. As I pointed out in my March 2023 speech, it is helpful to think of headline inflation as being driven by three factors: (i) underlying inflation; (ii) a reverting component; and (iii) pure noise.[4] In particular, the major dislocations of recent years induced a substantial reverting component of inflation that was sufficiently long-lasting not to constitute pure noise but that was also expected to fade out over time. These dislocations included the impact of energy inflation and supply bottlenecks. To capture their indirect impact on measures of underlying inflation, we have in parallel monitored adjusted measures of underlying inflation that “partial out” these indirect influences. These adjusted measures had a significantly lower peak rate of underlying inflation than the un-adjusted measures but, by construction, were also less affected by the sharp turnaround in energy prices and easing of supply bottlenecks during 2023 that flattered the speed of progress in the un-adjusted measures. Currently, these adjustments bring down the range to between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent, as the impact of past supply-side shocks has greatly diminished. In particular, the forward-looking PCCI measures are by now free of such impacts.

Notes: HICPX stands for HICP inflation excluding energy and food; HICPXX for HICP inflation excluding energy, food, travel-related items, clothing and footwear; PCCI is the persistent and common component of inflation, while Supercore aggregates HICPX items sensitive to domestic business cycle. See also Bańbura et al. (2023), “Underlying inflation measures: an analytical guide for the euro area”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 5, ECB. The ‘adjusted’ measures abstract from energy and supply-bottlenecks shocks using a large SVAR, see Bańbura, M., Bobeica, E. and Martínez-Hernández, C. 2023, “What drives core inflation? The role of supply shocks.”, ECB Working Paper No 2875. The latest observations are for September 2024. Each measure of underlying inflation provides useful information about future headline inflation, although their forecasting performance varies. Chart 2 shows the root mean squared forecast error (RMSFE) for each measure vis-à-vis inflation two years ahead and vis-à-vis a smoothed inflation rate. Forecasting performance is normalised to the predictive power of current headline inflation: that is, a ratio below unity means that the measure does a better job than current headline inflation in forecasting future inflation. Indeed, most measures beat current headline inflation in forecasting future inflation. The PCCI measures have the best predictive power, while most exclusion-based measures perform less well. However, in understanding the inflation process and calibrating monetary policy, it is essential to look beyond overall predictive power and also examine how the various underlying inflation measures can shed light on the speed and sequencing of the disinflation process. For instance, external shocks were a prominent feature of the post-pandemic economic landscape.[5] While the PCCI measures provided a powerful signal that these shocks would ultimately fade out, the delayed and lagged adjustment in indicators such as services inflation, domestic inflation and wage growth served to highlight that convergence to the medium-term target would not be immediate.[6] I will focus on these indicators in the next part of my talk. Chart 2 Predictive properties of underlying inflation measures for HICP inflation (RMSFE of each measure relative to RMSFE of headline inflation) Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations. Notes: RMSFE 24 months and RMSFE smoothed HICP are the root mean squared forecast errors of each measure with respect to headline inflation 24 months ahead and the two-year centred moving average of inflation covering two years of future data, respectively, divided by the RMSFE of headline inflation. A ratio lower than unity indicates that the measure performs better than headline inflation. The sample covers the period from April 2001 to September 2024. Services, domestic inflation and wages Domestic inflation captures price dynamics in consumption items that are less influenced by external factors, being more determined by domestic economic conditions, including monetary policy. While trends in the relative prices of globally-determined components (mostly in the energy, food and goods categories) mean that the two per cent target for overall inflation is not a target for domestic inflation, domestic inflation cannot remain at an excessive level if the target is to be sustainably achieved.[7] Moreover, assessing the strength of domestic inflation is essential to the calibration of monetary policy, since domestic inflation will be more responsive than global inflation components to the impact of monetary policy via the dampening of domestic demand. The domestic inflation indicator monitored at the ECB is an aggregation of HICP items with low import content.[8] As shown in Chart 3, domestic inflation and services inflation co-move closely. This reflects the dominance of services items in the domestic inflation measures, accounting for 97 per cent of the overall index. At the same time, it remains useful to maintain domestic inflation and services inflation as separate measures: while almost 80 per cent of the services items are included in the domestic inflation index, the overall services category also includes highly-traded services items (Chart 4). These internationally-traded services items currently have a lower contribution to services inflation than domestic services items. Chart 3 Services inflation and domestic inflation (annual percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations. Notes: Domestic inflation is an aggregate of HICP items with a relatively low import intensity, as explained in Fröhling, A., O’Brien, D. and Schaefer, S. (2022), “A new indicator of domestic inflation for the euro area”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 4, ECB. The latest observations are for September 2024. Chart 4 Services inflation and domestic inflation (percentage point contribution to services inflation) Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations. Notes: The chart shows all services items and the x axis shows the contribution of each item to total services inflation in September 2024. In weighted terms, 80 per cent of services are in domestic inflation and 97 per cent of domestic inflation is composed of services items. Domestic inflation also includes three good items which are not shown on the chart. The large supply-side shocks of the post-pandemic period have been feeding through to domestic inflation with a lag compared with other measures of underlying inflation. Large supply-side shocks have travelled across sectors and consumption items at different speeds, so it is unsurprising that these had differential impacts on the various measures of underlying inflation, depending on their nature and construction. Domestic inflation and services inflation tend to lag headline inflation more than other measures, exhibiting a lower frequency of price adjustment compared with the energy, food and goods categories in the HICP.[9] For this reason, many items in services inflation and domestic inflation were late movers that responded with a much longer lag to the latest inflationary shock, such that annual services inflation remains elevated.[10] Chart 5 shows the impact of energy and supply-chain bottlenecks on the PCCIs, domestic inflation and other measures of underlying inflation. Among these measures, PCCIs are more forward-looking and have picked up certain shocks faster, but with the byproduct that the effects of the shocks also faded quicker. Other indicators, like domestic inflation, are more backward-looking, and the currently higher levels also reflect the still ongoing propagation of past shocks. In similar vein, the past shocks took longer to build up in domestic inflation and are also taking longer to dissipate. Chart 5 Impact of energy and supply-side bottlenecks shocks across measures of underlying inflation (percentage points) Impact of energy-related shocks Impact of global supply chain-related shocks Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations Notes: The range covers the estimated impact of shocks across all monitored underlying inflation measures. The impact of the energy and supply bottleneck shocks are estimated in a large SVAR, see Bańbura, M. et al. (2023), op. cit.. The latest observations are for September 2024. The PCCI for services indicates that there is currently a sizeable gap between services inflation and its medium-term underlying trend, suggesting there is scope for downward adjustment in services inflation in the coming months. Services PCCI has been around 2.4 per cent since the end of last year, well below the current annual rate for services (Chart 6, left panel).[11] This difference suggests that idiosyncratic and non-persistent factors are currently driving services inflation. Examples of such idiosyncratic factors include the base effect related to the introduction of the cheap travel Deutschland-ticket in Germany in May 2023, rent inflation in the Netherlands, and items that reprice less frequently, such as insurance or other administered prices (like hospital services) in some countries. Over time, the fading out of these idiosyncratic and temporary factors should means that services inflation declines towards the underlying rate. Indeed, momentum indicators for services confirm the slight easing of inflation dynamics. While services momentum (i.e. the three-month-on-three-month growth rate of the seasonally-adjusted index) remains high, it has been continuously easing since May (Chart 6, right panel). The month-on-month seasonally-adjusted rate markedly dropped in September.

Note: The latest observations are for September 2024. Services and domestic inflation are closely linked to wage growth: the expected easing of wage growth in 2025, together with the impact of past monetary policy tightening, should contribute to further disinflation. Wages constitute a higher direct share in costs of services than goods and Chart 7 highlights the strong link between domestic inflation, services and wages: their level is normally similar and they closely co-move with each other.[13] Chart 7 also shows how pressures in these three components can take time to moderate following a tightening in policy. Chart 7 Services and domestic inflation and wage growth after episodes of monetary policy tightening (annual percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat, ECB and ECB calculations. Notes: Shaded areas show monetary policy tightening episodes. CPE stands for compensation per employee. The dotted line shows latest Eurostat data up to Q2 2024 for CPE carried forward with quarter-on-quarter rates from the September ECB staff projections. The latest observations are for the second quarter of 2024 for CPE and the third quarter of 2024 for the rest. Wage growth is expected to ease from its current high level, with the cumulative increase in nominal wages over 2023-2024 largely restoring the purchasing power that was lost during the inflation surges of 2021-2022. Wage pressures are currently still high: the growth rate of compensation per employee stood at 4.5 per cent in the second quarter of 2024, albeit down from its peak of 5.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2023. Recently, the incoming information for 2024 in the ECB wage tracker indicator of latest agreements shows that wage agreements signed in 2024 had substantially lower structural wage growth for the next 12 months if their previous agreement was signed in 2023 or 2022, as compared with 2021 (Chart 8, left panel). Moreover, in the months ahead, there are fewer wage agreements coming up for renegotiation that have not had an agreement since the surge in inflation (Chart 8, right panel). This suggests that the catching up motive in wage negotiations is losing ground as inflation normalises. Forward-looking indicators suggest further diminishing wage pressures into 2025 (Chart 9). The forward-looking wage tracker (dark blue line in Chart 9) shows the wage growth until the end of 2025 in the available contracts that have been agreed and signed. One caveat in interpreting developments in the forward- looking wage tracker is that, since it only considers agreements that are active in the future, the contract coverage on which it is based declines as contracts expire (solid grey area in Chart 9). For this reason, scenarios for the expiring contracts (in the grey striped area) can help to assess risks around the outlook for wages. The scenarios illustrated in Chart 9 assume different renegotiated annual wage growth for expired contracts: (i) full pass-through of HICP and real productivity growth top-up to wages; (ii) HICPX and real productivity growth top-up to wages; (iii) wages increase at the same very strong level as contracts signed in the second quarter of 2024 that were still recouping large real wage losses (this is an upper bound scenario). Even this upper-bound scenario points to a slowdown in wage pressures in 2025 compared with 2024. This reflects in part that base effects, for example those related to high one-off payments this year, will dampen future wage growth in year-on-year terms.

Chart 9 Euro area wage tracker – forward-looking scenarios (annual percentage changes) Sources: ECB staff calculations based on the ECB wage tracker database. Notes: The forecast scenarios take sectors with contracts expiring after the current date and assumes that new contracts are concluded with a structural wage increase per year based on a full pass-through of projected (September 2024 ECB staff projections) HICP or HICPX inflation and productivity growth (scenarios HICP+PROD and HICPX+PROD), or at the same rate of wage increase observed for contracts signed in the second quarter of 2024 (forecast scenario Q2 2024). The forward-looking tracker only considers active agreements. All scenarios include one-off payments smoothed over 12 months. The latest observations are for December 2025. The latest information from surveys reinforces the projection of easing wage growth that will underpin the moderation in services inflation and domestic inflation. Chart 10 presents consecutive rounds of various ECB surveys, which provide a wealth of valuable information that helps us gauge the pulse of the economy in real time. The incoming survey information on wage growth provided by both firms and professional forecasters confirm the narrative embedded in our September 2024 ECB staff projection that wage growth will ease in 2025 compared with 2024, primarily owing to the fading out of the catch-up dynamic that has dominated wage negotiations between 2022 and 2024.

Notes: The SAFE survey asks 12-month-ahead wage growth, while all the other surveys are for calendar years. In summary, in analysing services inflation and domestic inflation, it is crucial to distinguish between the underlying persistent component that matters for the medium term and the backward-looking reverting component that takes time to fade out but that ultimately reflects the staggered nature of the adjustment process to the original and extraordinary inflation shocks. This backward-looking component has been substantial: the inflation shocks of 2021-2022 spread across sectors at varying speeds. The slowest-moving sectors were those in which prices adjust more slowly or are most closely tied to wage adjustment. For these indicators, we need patience as the normalisation process takes time. Conclusion In my remarks today, I have sought to provide an update on the dynamics of underlying inflation. I have emphasised that underlying inflation measures not only serve to extract the persistent component from the latest inflation readings but also provide insights into the nature of disinflation, especially in relation to the staggered nature of the adjustment process. In particular, the analysis of underlying inflation suggests that 2024 is a transition year, in which backward-looking components are still playing out. But the analysis of underlying inflation also indicates that the disinflation process is well on track, and inflation is set to return to target in the course of 2025.

See Almuzara, M. and Sbordone, A. (2024), “Measurement and Theory of Core Inflation”, Staff Reports No 1115, Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Most of this decline happened by March this year, since then it has edged down only slightly. Lane, P. (2023), “Underlying inflation”, lecture at Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, 6 March 2023. See, for instance, Forbes, K., Jongrim, H. and Ayhan, K. M. (2024), “Rate Cycles”, presentation at the 2024 ECB Forum on Central Banking Sintra, Portugal, 3 July. This is confirmed when employing a forecast combination algorithm for the available underlying inflation measures designed to minimise the two-year ahead RMSFE for headline inflation. Over time, the algorithm tends to pick one or more of the monitored measures, but recently PCCIs have prevailed. To the extent that trend productivity growth is higher in more tradable sectors such as manufacturing than in less tradable sectors such as services, the relative price of services will trend higher over time so that the average inflation rate for services will be higher than for goods. At the same time, the equilibrium relative price of services versus goods can shift over time due to a range of factors. See Fröhling, A., O'Brien, D. and Schaefer, S. (2022).

Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB at XXI Villa Mondragone International Economic Seminar“Global Crisis and Long Term Growth: A New Capitalism Ahead?”Tor Vergata Economic Foundation andCEIS – Centre for Economic and International StudiesUniversity of Rome,Rome, 24 June 2009 Introduction [1] Let me begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to this conference in Villa Mondragone. It’s a honour to give the “ Riccardo Faini Lecture”. Riccardo was not only a great Colleague, at the IMF and at the Italian Treasury, but also a friend. The international economy is going through one of the worst recessions in generations. Demand and output have fallen sharply and synchronously in many developed and developing economies. Unemployment has drifted up. Global trade has shrunk for the first time in almost three decades, leading some to talk about incipient ‘de-globalisation’. Spare capacity has grown, dampening inflationary pressures – in central bank speak, downside risks to price developments have emerged – and fears of a sustained period of deflation are spreading. On the other hand, unprecedented recessionary forces have elicited an unprecedented policy response. Monetary policy has been swiftly loosened, both with conventional and unconventional tools. Governments have embraced aggressive fiscal expansions. The speedy reactions have surprised many observers, leading some to argue that inflation, not deflation, is the spectre that we have to fear over the next few years. The worry is that abundant liquidity combined with high fiscal deficits may trigger inflation once a recovery is underway, if policy-makers are unable or unwilling to reverse the policy stimulus on time. The debate between those who consider that inflation represents the main risk for advanced economies over the next few years and those who instead believe that deflation is the most immediate threat, has polarised, especially in the United States. It has also had an interesting echo here in Europe. [2] Both concerns are legitimate. To some extent, the fact that informed observers can maintain both views simultaneously can be seen as a sign that monetary policy is managing to walk the fine line between the two risks. The debate neatly encapsulates the trade-off currently facing policy-makers. They have to choose between short-term adjustments to strong recessionary forces and long-term macroeconomic stability. A key challenge is how to calibrate the policy response in the face of these forces: too timid a reaction may be costly in the near term, but an overreaction may sow the seeds of the next crisis. I will argue that a policy action that aims to ensure macroeconomic stability in the medium term requires a thorough examination of the risks, in much the same way as a disease calls for a sound diagnosis if it is to be properly treated. I will start the discussion by explaining how deflationary risks should be monitored and assessed by central banks, in particular with respect to the current situation. I will then turn to inflation expectations, over the short and medium term, to assess in particular how well they are anchored to the objective of price stability. Then I will consider how monetary and credit aggregates can be of use in the current conditions to assess the balance of risks. I will conclude with the monetary policy actions required to ensure price stability in an environment subject to downward and upward pressures to price stability. 1. Short-term deflation risks To discuss deflation risks in the euro area, it is useful to begin with a definition. Deflation is a decline in the general level of prices as measured by an index of consumer prices. [3] This decline affects most, if not all, prices in the economy. It has to be persistent – and last for an extended period of time, say, at least a year. And it has to be entrenched in agents’ expectations. As the chart (slide 2) indicates, euro area inflation - measured in terms of rate of change of the price level over the previous 12 months - has declined sharply from a peak of 4% in July of last year to 0% in May, the lowest rate since the beginning of Monetary Union. It is widely expected to dip into negative territory this month and is likely to remain there for most of the summer. However, although such rates of inflation are clearly below our definition of price stability, they do not exemplify deflation as we have just defined it. [4] For one thing, this spell of negative inflation is mainly driven by price developments in two sectors, energy and food, and it is the temporary result of the steep rises and sharp falls in oil and food commodity prices last year. Excluding energy and food, there is little sign of widespread price cuts so far; the rate of inflation remains between 1% and 2%. Overall, there are no signs of a generalised reduction in prices. Chart 3 shows the share of HICP items experiencing price falls, year on year. In terms of expenditure weights, around 20% of the HICP items reported negative annual growth rates in May 2009. This share has increased recently but it remains not so distant from the average of the last decade. Excluding food and energy, the share was lower at 14%. The share of items with negative inflation is subject to significant volatility, partly owing to seasonal factors, such as sales in the shops at certain times of the year. This makes the measure more difficult to interpret. However, it is possible to take account of these factors by comparing the proportion of items with negative inflation rates in any given month with the historical average for the same month. As you can see from chart 4, the share of items with negative inflation rates (excluding energy and food) in the year to May was only a touch higher than the historical average, further confirming that there have been no widespread price cuts so far. Let me dwell on this point. Chart 5 shows the distribution of the annual rates of change in all the items included in the HICP basket, weighted by their expenditure share. This also suggests that price cuts are not generalised, but are concentrated on few items. In May this year the bulk of the distribution – around two- thirds – showed inflation rates above 1%, with some items (heat energy) recording an inflation rate above 10%. The items with negative inflation rates are those such as clothes or electronic devices, which undergo constant quality improvements. A few items, mainly related to oil, recorded very strong price cuts. To check whether price cuts are generalised beyond food and energy, we could look at measures that exclude such items. These – the so-called measures of exclusion-based underlying inflation – can be constructed in several ways. I won’t go into the technical details here. Let’s just take the lowest and the highest at any point in time and construct a range. This range is shown as the shaded area of Chart 6, together with the headline inflation rate. The range has come down from the peak and is at or below 1.8%. Although this level is below the ECB definition of price stability, it is not exceptionally low and is actually higher than in 1998/1999, when underlying measures fell around 1%. International organisations, private forecasters and indeed the ECB expect this spell of negative inflation to be reversed, as suggested by inflation forecasts for 2009 and 2010. This can be seen, for example, from slide 7. It plots the latest HICP inflation forecasts from the Euro Zone Barometer – a publication that produces macroeconomic and financial forecasts every month from a number of major economic forecasters in Europe. In this month’s edition, forecasters expect the spell of negative inflation in 2009 to last on average for a few months. Looking at the range of individual responses (which is shown as a shaded area), there is some disagreement between the highest and lowest forecast. But even in the lowest forecast, the period with negative inflation rate is expected to last no more than two quarters. Furthermore, according to the same survey, inflation projections for 2010 have been gradually revised downwards since January 2009 as economic conditions have deteriorated. This phenomenon is illustrated in slide 8, as a month-to-month shift to the left of the inflation forecasts. Nevertheless, the median projection still remains above 1%. So, if there is no evidence of a generalised and persistent fall in the price level in the latest inflation outturns, what is underpinning current deflationary fears? As I see it, when people think about deflation, they have in mind two possible scenarios. The first is that the accumulation of economic slack due to the recession may exacerbate downside risks to price developments, which in turn may lead to outright deflation as monetary policy loses traction in stabilising output. The second scenario is that a spell of negative headline inflation rates – perhaps due to the temporary impact of energy and food prices – might dislodge inflation expectations. Let me discuss these scenarios in turn. The Phillips curve provides a useful framework for assessing the impact of growing economic slack and inflation expectations on price developments. In its most basic form, this theory posits that the inflation rate depends positively on the expected rate of inflation and negatively on the degree of slack in the economy, as measured, for example, by the difference between the supply potential of the economy and aggregate output, in other words the output gap. With euro area GDP falling at an annual rate of 4.8% in the first quarter of 2009 and unemployment rising to 9.2% in April, there is little doubt that spare capacity is high. This should exert downward pressure on prices. But how strong is this downward pressure, and can it determine deflationary risks for the euro area? Precise estimates of the Phillips curve for the euro area are subject to controversy. They vary depending on the specification, the precise measures of the output gap and expectations used, and the time frame considered. However, the general indication from the existing studies is that, on average, relatively large and persistent changes in the output gap are needed to affect euro area inflation. [5] In comparative terms, these changes are much larger than, for example, in the US and the UK. A simple plot (slide 9) of the evolution of various measures of the output gap against that of inflation for the euro area confirms that movements in various measures of economic slack have played a fairly modest role in the inflation process in the euro area in recent years. [6] The same Phillips curve analysis suggests that changes in inflation expectations play a major role in shaping inflation developments, anchoring inflation and potentially mitigating the harmful outcomes resulting from temporary shocks. In such a setting, expectations pin down the level of inflation in the long run, while changes in the output gap lead to short-run accelerations or decelerations of inflation around that level. There are many caveats to using a Phillips curve framework to relate inflation developments to economic slack – for instance, measures of both inflation expectations and the output gap are subject to considerable uncertainty, non-linearities may arise, and the relationship may change over time. Moreover, the actual impact of slowing real economic activity on inflation depends crucially on the nature of the economic downturn, the types of shock hitting the economy, their magnitude and duration. Wage and price rigidities may also contribute to help to moderate inflationary responses to changing economic conditions in the short run. Overall, the current weakness in real economic activity would be expected to dampen inflationary pressures in the euro area but not to lead to outright deflation. The approach underscores that while economic slack may contribute to movements of inflation in the short run, well-anchored inflation expectations are a crucial determinant in the inflation process. 2. Inflation expectations Inflation expectations cannot be observed directly, but approximate measures can be derived indirectly in three different ways: asking a sample of consumers, surveying professional forecasters and extracting information from financial markets. Let me elaborate. The European Commission conducts a poll every month in which it seeks consumers’ opinions on inflation developments in the euro area, in particular their perceptions of current inflation developments and their expectations for the next 12 months. These two measures are plotted in Chart 10, together with actual inflation. Consumers’ expectations have declined strongly in recent months, reaching a record low in May (the survey started in 1985). Most respondents thought that prices would either remain unchanged or fall in the next 12 months. But this is not really the same as expecting deflation. The second way of measuring inflation expectations is via the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters. It suggests that most respondents regard deflation as unlikely. In the second quarter of 2009, none of the 50 participants reported a negative point estimate for 2009, and two participants reported a point estimate below zero for 2010. Together with point estimates, participants are also asked to assess the likelihood of future inflation falling within given ranges. Averaging the individual responses provides a summary of their assessment. As Chart 11 shows, in the most recent survey, respondents assigned an overall 18% probability that annual inflation will be negative in 2009 (left side of the chart), which is significantly higher than in previous rounds. In 2010 (right side of the chart), there was a 6% probability associated with negative inflation; higher than in the previous rounds but still relatively contained. Participants are also asked to provide their projections about inflation five years ahead, which can be taken as a measure of medium-term inflation expectations and hence of the credibility of the central bank. These have remained firmly anchored, as the next chart indicates (slide 12). All survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations stood at 1.9% in April. Financial instruments are the third way of obtaining information about market participants’ inflation expectations. They also contain information about inflation risks, since investors not only demand compensation for the level of expected inflation but also for bearing the risk associated with the inflation outlook. In practice, yields on inflation-linked bonds are used as a basis to derive indicators of inflation expectations. [7] However, since the beginning of the crisis, bond markets have been exposed to significant disturbances that have made the measurement of inflation expectations and the associated risks more difficult than usual. Thus, it is useful to complement this measure with expectations extracted from inflation derivatives. In particular, inflation-linked swap rates provide a measure of the expected inflation rates at short horizons (one and two years ahead, for example). [8] One-year inflation swap rates fell sharply in the second half of 2008 (slide 13), following the decline in oil prices and the worsened macroeconomic outlook, and remained between 0.0% and 0.5% until recently. However, they have returned to levels above 1% since early April 2009. The chart also displays market uncertainty about the future inflation outcomes in the euro area, represented by the coloured areas. Unsurprisingly, uncertainty has increased since October 2008. Furthermore, in line with developments in point expectations, the probability associated with negative inflation readings within a 12-month horizon increased in the months following October 2008, as indicated by the shaded areas below the zero line, but has declined somewhat in recent months. The evolution of the term structure of inflation expectations suggests a similar pattern of gradual adjustment at slightly longer horizons (slide 14). Two-year-ahead inflation expectations have moved in tandem with shorter inflation expectations. Yet, the fact that they have never become negative, and that they are now back at levels ‘close to, but below, 2%’ – which is the ECB’s definition of price stability – offers further ‘comfort’ for monetary policy. It should be kept in mind that the liquidity of shorter-term inflation swaps is somewhat inferior to longer-horizon contracts, and the readings should thus be interpreted with appropriate care. In contrast to developments in short-term inflation expectations, long-term euro area inflation expectations and the associated risks have remained relatively stable (slide 15). For example, the five-year forward break-even inflation rate (BEIR) five years ahead has fluctuated between 2.0% and 2.5%. Moreover, a decomposition of BEIRs into inflation expectations and related premia suggests nonetheless that the term structure of inflation risk premia in the euro area is upward sloping and its fluctuations are the main driver of fluctuations in BEIRs, with (long-term) inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with price stability. [9] Recent research has also shown that there are substantial differences in the determinants of short and long-term inflation expectations derived from BEIRs in the euro area. [10] In particular, actual inflation readings are the main reason for movements in short-term BEIRs, but play no role in explaining long-term ones. Thus, the expected brief spell of negative overall inflation in the coming months does not seem to have no noticeable impact on longer-term BEIRs, thereby supporting the idea of well-anchored expectations in the euro area. At least so far. Overall, the evidence suggests that the euro area is a long way from generalised, persistent and expected deflation. The severity of the recession points to inflation remaining low in the next two years or so, but this is not expected to lead to the emergence of outright deflation. In any case, continuous monitoring is needed, as history shows ‘that deflation and deflation expectations can take root surprisingly quickly’. [11] The overall assessment is supported by a number of other indicators, in particular by developments in the labour market. In early 2009, wage growth remained fairly robust, although this may partly reflect hysteresis (slide 16). In particular, the annual growth rate of compensation per employee fell to 1.9% in 2009Q1, down from 2.8% in the fourth quarter. [12] Similarly, the rally in commodity prices will help to offset downward pressures on consumer prices. For instance, since the beginning of 2009 oil prices have more than doubled even when measured in euro. 3. Monetary indicators While economic analyses already provide a clear indication of the short to medium-term risks of a deflationary scenario, it might be helpful to compare them with the signals emanating from the monetary analysis. This notion is explicitly recognised in the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, where monetary trends provide information on price developments over the medium to longer term and serve as a means of cross-checking the short to medium-term indications for risks to price stability coming from economic analyses. The positive and often almost one-to-one relationship between inflation and monetary growth over longer horizons is perhaps one of the best documented results in economics and has been confirmed in a variety of empirical studies, both across time and across countries. [13] However, a critical test for any kind of analysis is whether an assessment of the data against the principles of the strategy can be translated into practical and relevant policy advice. As regards monetary analysis, this boils down to whether it is possible to separate in real time the important signal for future inflation embedded in the trends of monetary developments from the inevitable noise in the actual monetary data. At the ECB, many measures of monetary liquidity are investigated and assessed for the implied risks to price stability. It is worth mentioning in this context that the various measures should not be regarded as mutually exclusive but rather as providing an encompassing view. An obvious measure characterising the rate of monetary expansion consists of the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3, a measure that tends to attract most attention in the public debate. As we can see in Chart 17, annual M3 growth decelerated further in the first quarter of 2009 compared with previous quarters. Together with the parallel deceleration in loan growth, this points to a lower pace of underlying monetary dynamics and thus moderate inflationary pressures. However, in times of financial turmoil and economic uncertainties, the behaviour of money holders, borrowers and lenders may give rise to sudden changes in money and credit dynamics, and the backward-looking nature of annual growth rates may then not immediately provide a reliable signal for current dynamics. Looking forward, a complementary perspective, however, would focus less on the analysis of growth rates and more on the level of excess money accumulated in the past. The level of excess monetary liquidity that may have built up during a boom phase can be reabsorbed through a de-leveraging process. More precisely, over the medium term, the deceleration in the pace of money growth may lead to a direct unwinding of accumulated monetary liquidity (i.e. via de-leveraging in a number of sectors of the economy), thereby dampening price pressures. However, a protracted destruction of monetary liquidity would most likely have adverse effects on the real economy and increase the risk of deflation. On the other hand, if the excess monetary liquidity is not reabsorbed via de-leveraging, then the existing liquidity accumulation of recent years would still be available once the economy improves and may then lead to spending and inflationary pressures over the medium to longer term. Another useful monetary indicator is provided by the growth rates of M1. In contrast to developments in M3, the growth rate of the narrow monetary aggregate M1 has – after a trough in the third quarter of 2008 – started to rise again, and reached 5.3% in the first quarter of 2009. While M1 developments usually prove inferior to M3 developments in terms of their information content about future inflation, in the case of the euro area they have traditionally exhibited good leading indicator properties for future real GDP growth. Taken per se, such a development would also speak against a deflationary scenario and might offer valuable insights into the timing of the recovery. To conclude, monetary indicators provide important information to try understanding the likelihood of different scenarios ahead. In this respect, the real-time problem which is always prevalent in monetary analysis – but also in other types of analysis – becomes more serious in a financial crisis. 4. Short and long term policy responses to the crisis There are inevitable challenges associated with policy actions in times of crisis. Central banks around the world have embarked on untested areas of monetary policy-making. Expansionary fiscal policies and government interventions to stabilise the financial sector are expected to dramatically increase public debt. This could pose a severe threat to the sustainability of public finances and eventually to macroeconomic stability. To preserve macroeconomic stability over the medium term, there is a need for careful monitoring of the policy stimulus over the policy-relevant horizon, combined with well-designed exit strategies from non-standard policy-making. The design and calibration of the ECB’s monetary policy response to the crisis has taken into account not only the short term deflationary risks but also the longer-term inflation risks that could eventually result from the policy measures implemented with a view to counteract the former risks. Since the financial crisis escalated in September 2008, the ECB has reacted to emerging downside risks to price stability with both conventional and unconventional actions. Conventional policy action has led to reduce the ECB’s key policy interest rates to a level that is unprecedented. In parallel, a wide range of non-standard measures has been put in place, mainly to stabilise the money market. With policy rates at record lows and additional liquidity-providing measures adopted in so many countries, we are all well aware of the possibility of inflation risks ahead and the need for a credible and well-designed exit strategy. Retaining such exceptional policy measures for too long might aggravate the upside risks to price stability and sow the seeds of future imbalances in financial markets. Getting the timing right in withdrawing excess liquidity will be key to a non-inflationary recovery. Generally speaking, the more difficult it is to reverse non-standard operations, the greater the risk is of being behind the curve when the macroeconomic and financial market situation improves. For the central bank to maintain price stability over the medium term, we know that monetary policy must not be overburdened with other objectives: it needs to be conducted within an institutional framework which rules out any type of fiscal dominance. I do not need to elaborate further on how profligate fiscal policy can eventually produce inflationary pressures. A ‘lax’ fiscal authority which seeks to avoid the short-term political costs associated with enforcing fiscal discipline could be tempted to finance its budget through money creation. Indeed, inflation erodes the real value of public debt. However, such an outcome can be ruled out in the euro area because of the existing institutional arrangements. The Treaty establishing the European Community assigns responsibility for monetary policy to the ECB and unambiguously entrusts it with the primary objective of maintaining price stability. To fulfil this responsibility effectively, the ECB and the national central banks have been granted a high degree of independence. Under Article 101(1) of the Treaty, central banks are also prohibited from extending credit to, or purchasing public debt instruments directly from, the primary market. By preserving the financial independence of the ECB and the Eurosystem and the integrity of their balance sheet, this prohibition makes monetary policy more credible. In the same vein, the prohibition also helps to strengthen fiscal discipline and thereby to promote the smooth functioning of Monetary Union. The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is an additional measure to ensure fiscal discipline and the long-term sustainability of public finances. To conclude, the ECB is committed to its primary objective of maintaining price stability, which has been defined as a rate of increase of the general price level of less than 2% but close to 2% over the medium term. This requires a constant monitoring of all inflationary risks, both upward and downward, on the basis of a series of indicators and analytical instruments. Ultimately, the firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains the best way to check the appropriateness of monetary policy in an uncertain environment. Thank you very much for your attention.

[2] In the United States, the debate is well captured by the two editorials that appeared in the New York Times on 4 May 2009: one by Paul Krugman arguing that Japan-style deflation loomed; and the other by Allan Meltzer fearing a return of 1970s inflation: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/opinion/. See also The Economist of 9 May 2009, page 15. The risk of global deflation has been pointed out in several articles by Nouriel Roubini ( www.rgemonitor.com). Inflation risks in Europe and globally were flagged by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a speech in Berlin on 2 June 2009 (http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_1498/Content/DE/Rede/2009/06/2009-06-02-merkel-insm.html). [3] Throughout this speech, when I mention euro area inflation, I will always refer to the measure provided by Eurostat’s HICP, unless I specify otherwise. [4] See also Bini Smaghi, L. (2008), “Careful with (the “d”) words!”, The European Colloquia Series, Venice, 25 November 2008. [5] See, for example, Musso, Stracca and van Dijkx. [6] Real-time estimates of the output gap, which is an unobserved variable, are generally surrounded by uncertainty. This is the reason why a range of output gap estimates is reported. However, the uncertainty might be particularly large at the current juncture as it is especially difficult to determine whether the steep falls in output also dampen potential growth. There is no clear-cut solution to this problem. [7] See Ejsing, J., J.A. Garcia and T. Werner (2007) “The term structure of euro area break-even inflation rates: the impact of seasonality”, ECB Working Paper No 830; Gurkaynak, R., B. Sack and J. Wright (2009), “The TIPS yield curve and Inflation Compensation”, American Economics Journal: Macroeconomics, forthcoming.” [8] Other inflation derivatives allow investors to hedge against inflation rates exceeding certain threshold (inflation cap) or being below a certain level (inflation floor) and thereby convey information about the value of the perceived risk of hitting those thresholds by estimating option-implied densities and measures of perceived market uncertainty. Since the lowest maturity of caps and floors are two years (in some cases three years), the volatility is an average of the one and two-year (and three-year) caplet volatility. On average the term structure of volatility is relatively flat, making this a reasonable approximation for the one-year volatility. [9] Hördahl, P. and O.

[12] The steep drop in the growth rate in compensation per employee in 2009Q1 is mainly driven by strong downward developments in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium. Note that, combined with the recent release of productivity growth (-3.6%), unit labour costs growth increased further, from 4.5% in 2008Q4 to 5.7% in 2009Q1, marking a new record high since the start of EMU.

The three experiences differ in many dimensions, in particular with respect to timing and pace. The Federal Reserve started first, in June 2004, and since then rates have been raised by 425 basis points. The European Central Bank started in December 2005, with a 125 basis points increase in less than one year. In Japan the process has just started, in July 2006, with a 25 basis points increase from the zero interest rate floor. The three episodes have nevertheless some common features. In all cases the tightening cycle started from a historically low level of interest rates, both in nominal and real terms. At the starting point, the US Federal Fund rate was at 1 per cent in nominal terms and around -2 when deflated by headline inflation. The ECB refinancing rate was at 2 per cent in nominal terms and around zero in real terms. The Bank of Japan target for the overnight call rate was at zero both in nominal and real terms. The fact that the level of the nominal and real interest rate were rather low, compared to historical levels and to underlying economic and monetary conditions (such as the growth of nominal income and the output gap) suggests that at the start of the tightening cycle monetary policy was quite expansionary. In other words, the initial level of the interest rate was substantially below the so-called “neutral” level, which is the level of the interest rate that ensures price stability for given underlying conditions, at least in the most plausible scenario. Such a low level might have been warranted in the presence of sizeable downside risks, but was unsustainable once these risks receded. According to standard macroeconomic analysis, if the interest rate is systematically below its “neutral” level monetary policy is expansionary and might ultimately fuel inflationary pressures. Therefore, even if interest rate is raised but remains below the “neutral” level, monetary conditions continue to be expansionary, although to a lesser degree. On the basis of these considerations, it would appear that in spite of the recent interest rate increases in the three largest areas monetary conditions have remained significantly expansionary, as confirmed by the ample liquidity conditions prevailing at the global level. Rather than a fully-fledged monetary tightening one should thus rather speak of a reduction in the degree of monetary expansion. In a tightening cycle central banks have to address three main questions: When to start tightening? At what speed tighten? When to stop tightening? I will try to examine these three questions in light of the most recent experience and taking into account three main problems. First, an information problem: how to interpret incoming data to assess and forecast economic developments so as to calibrate the appropriate interest rate response. Second, an incentive (or perhaps I should say risk management) problem: how to balance the risk of acting too early or being too late, i.e. being ahead or behind the curve. Third, a communication problem: how to communicate policy decisions and intentions to the market and the public, especially in light of uncertainty about underlying economic developments, to promote predictability and safeguard the credibility of the central bank. These challenges are not independent and may actually compound, as I shall discuss in more detail later. Let’s examine the three questions in turn. Let me clarify from the start that the purpose of these considerations is to try develop a conceptual framework, based largely on the recent experience, rather than to provide indications about future monetary policy developments, in particular for the euro area. Indeed, the future might provide us with new insights, which have not been taken into account and that might lead to a reconsideration of this analysis. When to start tightening? It is well known that monetary policy implies long and variable transmission lags and that the lags are longer for inflation than for output. This implies that an optimal monetary policy tightening should start some quarters ahead of the upswing. If we start from a situation of negative excess demand, in which economic activity is lower than potential (negative output gap), the expectation of output growing above potential (so that the output gap closes) should trigger the start of tightening. If the central bank fails to increase interest rates at that point, inflationary pressures might pile up. An important corollary is that the start of the tightening cycle should not wait for headline inflation to rise. The increase in interest rate, which as I mentioned previously initially entails only a reduction in the degree of monetary expansion rather than an absolute tightening, has to start before inflationary pressures materialise. It is aimed at ensuring that inflation does not rise later on, when it is too late and more costly to bring inflation down. The sooner interest rates are raised, as economic activity recovers, the less interest rates will have to be increased later on to maintain price stability. In implementing this strategy the central bank is faced with the three problems mentioned previously. Let me start with the information problem. It is very difficult to forecast the beginning of an upswing, giving the uncertainties prevailing around turnarounds. According to some, this problem should not be so serious. If the central bank has a simple linear-quadratic loss function, uncertainty does not affect the optimality of the policy decision, ex-ante. The central bank should thus use its best forecast as a basis for such a decision.[1] The experience of the early 1970s confirms that hesitating for too long at the start of a tightening cycle may be quite dangerous. Recent research has shown that the Great Inflation of the 1970s may have originated from the combination of an information problem (the difficulty of assessing the level of excess demand in real time[2]) and an incentive problem, due to the fact that a tightening would have been politically costly at times of rising unemployment and slowing output growth, especially in an intellectual environment in which the long-term link between inflation and monetary policy was less than fully clear.[3] Some might find it appropriate for the central bank to wait until there is clear evidence that growth has picked up above potential and that the output gap has started to close before starting to tighten. The risk of having possibly waited too long and having been behind the curve could be reduced through an acceleration of the pace of tightening thereafter. However, as I have indicated in a speech made in Berlin about one year ago, the risk of getting behind the curve (what I then called “Type I” error) might further increase if the tightening starts at an interest rate level that is substantially below the “neutral” level.[4] One lesson that might be drawn from the recent tightening cycle is that the lower is the starting point, in terms of interest rate level, the less a central bank can afford to wait to have confirmation of the ongoing recovery before starting to tighten. To be sure, even if the central bank might have some room to wait for data confirming the economic pick up, it should certainly not wait for inflation to be on the rise to increase interest rates. This would clearly imply falling behind the curve and having to correct more abruptly at a later stage with sharper interest rate increases. For the ECB, the monetary pillar of the strategy, which is based on the analysis of money and credit aggregates, proved to be quite a useful complement to motivate the start of the monetary tightening (or I should perhaps say the “normalisation” of monetary conditions) at the end of 2005. In addition to the staff projections that were pointing to an inflation rate above the ECB’s definition of price stability over the whole forecasting horizon, the fast rate of growth of monetary and credit aggregates in the course of the second half of 2005 provided an independent confirmation that interest rates were extremely low in comparison to the underlying fundamentals. Not taking into account these monetary developments would have entailed a further risk of falling behind the curve, in an environment of very expansionary monetary conditions. A further challenge for the central bank is to explain the start of the tightening cycle to financial markets and the public at large. Relying on economic forecasts alone might be difficult as the timing and pace of economic recovery are generally subject to wide debate. In addition, politicians and social partners tend to ask the usual question: “Why are you increasing interest rates if there is no inflation?” The obvious answer to the question is that what matters is not the current inflation rate but the outlook for future price stability. However, given the uncertainties surrounding the assessment of the cyclical position, the central bank might want to use a variety of arguments and indicators to explain the reasons underlying the start of the tightening. I have found that a useful tool to address the communication challenge is a simple comparison between the prevailing real interest rate level and the rate of growth of real income. As I mentioned previously, at the end of 2005 the real interest rate was close to zero in the euro area, while the rate of growth of economic activity was progressively picking up, from a yearly pace of around 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent. Even somebody with a basic economic background would understand that under these conditions keeping interest rates unchanged, at around zero in real terms, would have implied an increase in the degree of monetary expansion, which would have not been compatible over time with price stability. The fast pace of monetary and credit aggregates and the dynamics of asset prices confirmed that the prevailing level of interest rate was very low and potentially jeopardising price stability. How fast to tighten? The second issue I would like to address is the speed of adjustment of policy rates once a tightening process is initiated. This will of course depend inter alia on the strength of the recovery, the level of the output gap, the starting position and the distance of the actual interest rate from a plausible measure of its long-term equilibrium level. All these considerations will obviously be surrounded by a great deal of uncertainty. On the other hand, there is generally a lot of pressure on the central bank for it to be as explicit as possible on the foreseen interest rate path. How should central banks react to such a request? Should central banks communicate to the market on how quickly they intend to bring the interest rate back to the equilibrium level (assuming that they know what the equilibrium level is)? There is an interesting degree of variation in central bank practices around the world. Some central banks, notably the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (since 2000) and the Central Bank of Norway (since 2005) have started to provide the public with a quantitative indication of the most likely course of policy as part of their macroeconomic policy projections. Other central banks, most notably the Federal Reserve, have provided a qualitative guidance on the likely direction and pace of interest rate moves. The ECB has instead refrained from giving guidance to market participants beyond the very short term (one to two months), leaving to the latter the task of setting their own expectations. In my view, the idea of giving markets explicit forward guidance has some advantages, but also some drawbacks. Let me elaborate. There are three possible advantages of giving forward guidance to the markets, beyond the very short term. First, and most important, it may enhance the central bank leverage over long-term interest rates and therefore increases the potency of monetary policy. This may not be a very important consideration at all times, but it may become quite useful once the central bank faces a significant risk of hitting the zero bound on nominal interest rates and if the private sector is unsure about the likely monetary policy response under such conditions.[5] The objective of increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy may be particularly important if the central bank has previously fallen behind the curve and waited too long before increasing interest rates. Under these circumstances, preannouncement may help anchoring market expectations and avoid an increase in inflationary expectations. However, there is no guarantee that forward guidance will work if used occasionally, as I will explain in a moment. A second potential advantage is that forward guidance may provide observers with a better understanding of the central bank reaction function. Since the projected interest rate path is (quantitatively or qualitatively) dependent on the projected path of macroeconomic variables, a revelation of the preferred path may give the market more explicit information on how the central bank plans to react to certain (though hypothetical) developments. Interestingly enough, however, in Norway and New Zealand market interest rates have generally not always fully aligned to the path projected by the central bank. Finally, the necessity of giving the market some forward guidance automatically forces the policy-making bodies to agree on a baseline scenario for the future. This may provide a useful internal framework for discussion and favour a more structured and consistent communication policy. These are the advantages. But there are also drawbacks. First, even when they are not intended to be so, there is a certain risk that the projected interest rate path is interpreted by the markets as being as an unconditional commitment. This may happen even when the central bank is careful in explaining that deviations of actual rates from the projected path should be seen as the norm, rather than the exception, as is the case of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Central Bank of Norway. This is, in essence, a communication challenge. The problem is a serious one because the macroeconomic outlook might be subject to sizeable and frequent changes, in particular following the release of new data.[6] A central bank wishing to communicate in a consistent way the path of future interest rates would need to release a new path almost every month, or even more frequently, if it wants to be effective in its task of guiding markets and to be fully transparent. We can observe that the market yield curve can at times change quite significantly in a matter of weeks. For instance, the yield curve for the implied expected overnight rate in the euro area shifted down quite a bit between mid-August this year and mid-September.[7] If a central bank decided to communicate its expected interest rate path to guide the markets, it might have to do so with a very high frequency, at least on occasions. That could be quite confusing for market participants. The second problem, which has not been sufficiently debated in the literature but is, in my opinion, quite important is that providing forward guidance to markets, at least to the extent to which it is intended to steer longer-term interest rates, may be difficult and costly to implement. Forward guidance is effective if it is credible, and in order to be credible, the central bank has to deliver on past promises. Due to the unavoidable changes in the underlying economic conditions (here we see again the information problem arising), there may be occasions in which the central bank might have to deviate from its pre-announced path. In these cases it might not be clear ex post whether the central bank is reneging on past promises or simply reacting to newly available macroeconomic data in an optimal manner. For a central bank that needs to establish its reputation, for instance because it might have started the tightening cycle too late and have fallen behind the curve, there could be an incentive to stick to the pre-announced path rather than trying to explain a deviation from it, even if it is justified. Third, and related to my previous point, a successful forward guidance may pre-empt private sector expectations, reducing their information content. Rather than incorporating private information, bond prices would simply reflect the views of the central bank. Pre-empting private sector expectations of future interest rates would amount to restrict the information set on which policy is based. This would make monetary policy less effective, exacerbating the information problem.[8] While it is difficult to quantify the loss, my sense is that it would not be negligible. Finally, the need of agreeing on a full path of future interest rates, and eventually updating it in light of economic developments, might not be that easy, especially in a complex setting such as the Eurosystem where the Governing Council is composed of eighteen (soon nineteen) members. This consideration is especially important in a tightening cycle, when – as I mentioned earlier – monetary policy decisions are subject to criticism and political resistance. In such an environment, it has been suggested that taking a step at a time might be preferable than agreeing on a grand strategy all at once.[9] The relevance of this type of problem very much depends on the institutional setting within and surrounding the central bank, which varies from country to country. The analytical tools used by central banks are also of some relevance here. Deciding on a path for future interest rates is easier if the monetary policy is geared towards a single inflation projection, as in an inflation targeting framework. The ECB’s monetary policy strategy explicitly eschews the use of an all-encompassing model and is based on the systematic use of available information under the two pillars of the strategy. It is naturally much more difficult for this approach to be embedded in a one-dimensional model which automatically produces a nice chart for the future path of interest rates, conditional to a path for inflation forecasts. All in all, it can be questioned that a strategy aimed at providing markets with explicit forward guidance has more advantages than drawbacks. The experience of the ECB over the recent tightening cycle, which consists of giving guidance only over the very short term (one to two months) but not pre-committing beyond that horizon and basing rate decisions on underlying and projected economic developments has proved to be quite successful and well received by the markets. In terms of market volatility beyond the very short term, there seems to be no majors cost to be paid, as compared to strategies that are more explicit on future interest rate path.[10] For example, the degree of uncertainty perceived by market participants on the future course of monetary policy, as measured by the implied volatility on Euribor and Eurodollar futures contracts, is of the same order of magnitude in the euro area as in the US. Furthermore, sufficient flexibility has been kept to adjust the pace of the tightening to unexpected changes in the underlying economic conditions, moving in particular from a three month to a two months frequency in the 25 basis points increase. Also, the possibility has been used by the ECB to signal clearly to the markets when the prevailing expectations did not coincide with its own assessment of the interest rate path, leading to an immediate correction. What is really important, in my opinion, to effectively guide financial markets is to communicate very clearly the analytical framework of the central bank and how new information and data are incorporated in the decision making. This should enable market participants to derive their own expectation about the future path of interest rates. This strategy might be more effective than pre-announcing the pace of the monetary tightening. When to stop tightening? This is in fact the most difficult question to answer, not only because downturns are difficult to forecast but also because the cost of a policy mistake at that stage is higher and there is less room to make up for it later on. Stopping too soon might unleash further inflationary pressures as the economy starts weakening, thus reducing the room for cutting interest rates to accommodate the slowdown. Stopping too late might worsen the economic downturn, with the need to reverse rapidly the policy direction, undermining the credibility of the central bank. The end of the tightening cycle should ideally anticipate the turn of the cyclical position of the economy. If the economy grows above its potential and the output gap becomes positive, keeping inflationary pressures and expectations under control could require that the interest rate is increased above the long term equilibrium level. The main difficulty at the peak of the cycle is to calibrate the level of interest rate in such a way as to ensure price stability without affecting negatively economic growth. I would like to focus in particular on two variables relevant in this assessment: the growth rate of productivity and inflation expectations. Over the cycle, the strengthening of productivity growth temporarily moderates firms’ marginal costs, including labour costs, thus dampening inflationary pressure. One might conclude that as long as productivity recovers there is a lesser need to adjust interest rates because inflationary pressures are kept under control. This would be a wrong conclusion. Rising productivity implies a higher level of the “neutral” interest rate. Keeping market rates unchanged while the “neutral” rate rises implies, as we have seen previously, an expansion of monetary conditions that will ultimately lead to higher inflation. To avoid this effect interest rates have to be adjusted upwards, in line with the increase in the “neutral” rate. Hence, stronger productivity growth might result in higher, not lower nor constant, interest rates. Put differently, increasing productivity growth has a dampening effect on inflationary pressure only to the extent that the interest rate is adjusted to take into account the increase in the “neutral” level.[11] The reasoning is quite similar to that used in the through of the cycle to assess the appropriateness of the interest rate level against nominal income growth, using a simple monetary framework. As the economic recovery strengthens, and the negative output gap is reduced or even tends to become positive, the level of the interest rate needs to be adjusted to avoid monetary conditions becoming excessively expansionary. The analysis has to consider both the price and real component of nominal income. For instance, if inflation slows down, due to a fall in oil prices, but disposable income strengthens following the improvement in the terms of trade, the pace of nominal income growth could remain unchanged. This implies that the interest rate path should not be affected by the fall in inflation, especially if temporary. This point is not easily appreciated by market participants and observers, and thus implies some communication effort by central banks. Another indicator that might be useful in guiding a central bank in the decision of when to stop tightening is agents’ inflationary expectations. These indicators have to be used with some caution. In particular, evidence of stable long-term inflation expectations, consistent with price stability, do not necessarily imply that the monetary policy tightening can be stopped. There are at least two reasons for this. First, the analysis of data on inflation expectations is not straightforward since financial market indicators (such as break even inflation extracted from inflation-linked bond yields) tends to differ from, and be more reactive than expectations drawn from survey data. In the US, for example, inflation expectations derived from bond yields fluctuated significantly over recent years, while survey-based measures (such as those of the Philadelphia Fed Survey) have barely moved at all. It is therefore not obvious which measure is most reliable. Second, and most important, long term inflation expectations might remain low or even fall at the peak of the cycle, but might rise again if headline inflation does not rapidly fall in parallel with the slowdown of the economy. If this happens, it is then difficult (and costly for the real economy) to bring expectations back to levels consistent with price stability. It might require keeping rates at a significantly high level for some time. Indeed, experience suggests that expectations have some intrinsic inertia and cannot be easily reversed. It is therefore better to prevent an “inflation scare"" from happening, and not be forced to react to it ex post. All in all, it is important to monitor inflation expectations, but a central bank should not wait until they move substantially before adjusting rates. Otherwise it may be too late and further tightening might be needed to bring inflation expectations back to equilibrium.[12] In practice, therefore, there is no reason to think that the monetary policy tightening should necessarily stop at some long-term average level of interest rate (or any other empirical measure of the natural interest rate). This will depend inter alia on the position of the economy in the cycle, compared to its potential (output gap) and the persistence of inflationary pressures. It is then not surprising that deciding the end of the tightening cycle is as difficult as the start, if not more. The information problem is typically different at this stage, but no less challenging. In addition to the uncertainty on the timing of the cyclical peak and the sustainability of the recovery, there is an even greater one on whether the interest rate is at a level which may be deemed compatible with the maintainance of price stability. This is why the concept of “neutral” and long term equilibrium interest rates, while appealing in theory, are very difficult to use in practice for the implementation of monetary policy. The uncertainty surrounding the calculation of the “neutral” level of interest rate, in particular at the peak of the cycle, makes this concept very difficult to be made operational. There is by now a large body of literature on the real-time uncertainty surrounding the neutral and natural level of interest rates.[13] Some authors have suggested that central banks should concentrate on the changes in interest rates and forget about the level altogether, given the measurement problems.[14] It is certainly true that assessing the key components of the equilibrium real interest rate, in particular productivity growth, is not easy and can lead to persistent policy errors, even if the central bank behaves optimally.[15] In the euro area and in other countries, we have seen persistent forecast errors in growth and inflation, but to date we cannot be sure that such forecast errors derive from problems in measuring potential output growth or from the effects of temporary shocks. In practice, the end of the tightening cycle will have to remain dependent on the assessment of the underlying and projected economic conditions. These conditions are subject to change, following temporary or more permanent factors. It is thus very difficult to preannounce a given interest rate level or a given policy attitude to be followed around the peak of the cycle. The main guiding factor for interest rate adjustment has to remain the pursue of price stability over the relevant horizon for monetary policy and the anchoring of inflationary expectations. Conclusions Let me conclude by trying to put forward some general lessons that might be learned from the recent experience, which is clearly incomplete. These few comments are obviously non exhaustive and very schematic. They are presented in a synthetic way and should be considered as input for further discussion and reflection rather than providing any insight on future policy actions. To start tightening: Don't wait too long, especially if the signs of recovery are apparent and interest rates are at very low levels. The sooner tightening start, the less tightening might be needed later on. To be sure, don’t wait to see inflation rising before raising rates. It will be too late. Use a wide set of indicators and arguments to explain to market participants and the public at large why tightening is needed. Money and credit aggregates, asset prices and the level of interest rates might be useful indicators of why the time has come to reduce accommodation. While tightening: If the strength of the recovery is uncertain, don’t feel compelled to commit to a given path, even if the markets ask for it. Keep enough flexibility to be able to accelerate or slow down the tightening, depending on underlying economic conditions without appearing to change the underlying strategy. Use the same set of indicators mentioned above to explain why the pace of tightening needs to be adapted. At the end of the tightening: Don’t preannounce when (and at what interest rate level) the tightening will be over, but rather that it will depend on the development of the underlying fundamentals. Be aware that if the tightening is ended too soon, interest rates might have to remain at a high level for some time, even as the economy slows down. Monitor inflation expectations carefully, but do not wait until they rise before increasing interest rates. All in all, independently of the state of the tightening cycle, it is always important that market participants and the public at large have a clear understanding of the overall strategy that underlies monetary policy and of the analytical framework that leads to policy decisions. They should also understand the uncertainties underlying economic developments throughout the cycle, that complicate the decision making process. Agents should ideally be able to forecast the policy action of the central bank on the basis of the flow of information that they receive and of their understanding of the central bank strategy. These are the foundation of a predictable and credible monetary policy. Thank you for your attention. References Adam, K. and R.

[2] See, for example, Orphanides and van Norden (2005). [3] Nelson (2004) provides a survey of the factors that motivated the macroeconomic policies that led to the Great Inflation of the 1970s. The paper argues that the “monetary policy neglect” hypothesis – i.e. that policymakers took a non-monetary view of the inflation process – is a satisfactory explanation which is consistent with (1) the estimated monetary policy reaction function; (2) the timing patterns relating monetary policy developments and inflation; and (3) the record of economic views, as manifested in statements by policymakers and financial commentators. The output gap mis-measurement hypothesis, supplements the monetary policy neglect hypothesis. [4] See Bini Smaghi (2006). [5] See Adam and Billi (2006). [6] Reflecting the significant (and unavoidable) revisions in the growth and inflation outlook at horizons beyond a few months, it is very difficult to forecast interest rates accurately. In the euro area, for example, market expectations of future three-month interest rates one year out have been on average almost 1 full percentage point off the mark over recent years (see Charts 1 and 2 in the Annex). [7] See Chart 3 in the Annex. [8] This point is still controversial. See Morris and Shin (2002) and its criticism by Woodford (2005). [9] See Goodhard (2001) and Mishkin (2004). [10] See Brand, Buncic and Turunen (2006) for an analysis of the euro area yield curve and Gürkayanak, Sack and Swanson (2005) for the US. Brand, Buncic and Turunen (2006) conduct a comparative analysis and show that the impact of monetary policy decisions and communication on the yield curve is similar in the euro area and the US. [11] Chart 4 reports a measure of the real federal funds rate in the United States and of labour productivity growth. It is evident from the chart that, for example, the real interest rate was higher in the second half of the 1990s in the wake of the productivity growth acceleration, not lower, contrary to common opinion. [12] See Charts 5 and 6 in the Annex reporting break even inflation rates and the level of policy interest rates in the euro area and the US. It is evident that a lot of dynamics in the policy rates is needed in order to stabilise break even inflation rates. [13] See for example Laubach and Williams (2003).

This morning, I would like to speak to you about the ECB’s strategy review, the reasons we are conducting it, and our expectations as a result of it. Since 2003, when we last conducted a strategy review, the euro area and the world economy have undergone profound changes. The consensus that has governed monetary policy worldwide has been challenged on a number of fronts. Most importantly, the last decade has been defined by a persistent decline in inflation among advanced economies. In the euro area, annual inflation averaged 2.3% from 1999 to the eve of the great financial crisis in August 2008, but only 1.2% from then until the end of 2019. This environment poses fundamental questions for central banks. We need to thoroughly analyse the forces that are driving inflation dynamics today, and consider whether and how we should adjust our policy strategy in response. To inform this analysis, we also want to hear from a wide variety of stakeholders – including citizens, academics, parliamentarians and civil society organisations – about how they perceive our goals and actions. This is why we have launched the “ECB Listens” programme, in which we will aim to listen to as many voices as possible. As we have just restarted our strategy review – we put it on hold when the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic struck – I will not be presenting any conclusions today. Now is the time for listening and reflecting. But I will discuss the main issues we are looking at and some of the key questions we will be asking. In my remarks today I will cover three topics: first, the definition of our inflation objective; second, the relationship between inflation and the real economy; and third, the transmission and effectiveness of monetary policy. None of these issues can be considered in isolation and we need a well-rounded view of all elements in order to draw conclusions for the strategy review. The inflation objective I start with the inflation objective because it anchors the inflation process for the whole economy. Three issues will feature particularly prominently in our review. The first is how to formulate the inflation aim. The arguments in favour of central banks aiming for positive inflation rates with a sufficient buffer away from zero were articulated during our strategy review in 2003. It compensates for possible measurement bias, helps countries rebalance their economies within a monetary union and creates a buffer against deflation, as well as leading to higher nominal interest rates over the medium term. That helps ensure that monetary policy is not forced too often towards the effective lower bound – the level of interest rates at which further cuts do not have the desired positive impact – when faced with shocks that push inflation too low. Since 2003, the ECB has used a double-key formulation to set our objective, defining price stability as a year-on-year increase in inflation of “below 2%”, while aiming for inflation of “below, but close to, 2%”. This formulation was appropriate at a time when the ECB was seeking to establish credibility and too-high inflation was its main worry. As our research shows, it was a key factor in successfully capping inflation expectations.[1] But in the current environment of lower inflation, the concerns we face are different and this needs to be reflected in our inflation aim. Ensuring that there is sufficient space above zero to re-empower conventional monetary policy becomes more important. And, to underpin inflation expectations, we need to ensure that our aim is perceived to be symmetric by the public. So we should have an inflation aim that the public can easily understand. The second issue is the horizon over which price stability should be achieved, which is captured by the ECB’s “medium term” orientation. This forward-looking orientation reflects traditional and well-established principles of prudent monetary policy, which is consistent with the notion that monetary policy works with a lag and can influence inflation over the medium term rather than the near term. But within the ECB’s framework, the medium-term orientation has also been a way for the Governing Council to take into account what is happening in the real economy, including employment. We have a hierarchical mandate with price stability at the top. But the medium term, which is a flexible concept, allows us to avoid unnecessarily constricting jobs and growth in the event of a supply shock which temporarily pushes up inflation and generates an economic slump. The low inflation environment creates some new questions about how to operationalise the medium term. For instance, the existence of large and persistent disinflationary shocks related to, say, the ability to compare prices more actively via the internet and diversify suppliers is likely to call for more flexibility. But a persistent failure to meet the inflation aim can feed into inflation expectations and would call for a shorter policy horizon. We also need to reflect on our two pillar approach for assessing developments in the economy, which uses both economic and monetary analysis. Cross-checking between the two helps determine the risks to price stability. The monetary pillar could in principle be enhanced to provide information on financial stability which – over longer time horizons – could be relevant for the inflation outlook. Central banks have also considered adding a backward-looking element to the policy horizon in response to the low inflation environment. In the ECB’s case, the reference to underlying inflation dynamics in our forward guidance means that we already look at the past when deciding whether to change policy. The wider discussion today, however, is whether central banks should commit to explicitly make up for inflation misses when they have spent quite some time below their inflation goals. If credible, such a strategy can strengthen the capacity of monetary policy to stabilise the economy when faced with the lower bound. This is because the promise of inflation overshooting raises inflation expectations and therefore lowers real interest rates.[2] While make-up strategies may be less successful when people are not perfectly rational in their decisions[3] – which is probably a good approximation of the reality we face – the usefulness of such an approach could be examined. The third issue is the measure of inflation that lies behind our inflation aim. The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) has served us well so far and is continuously being improved. Examples of these improvements include how it accounts for quality change, annual changes in consumption weights, more granular categories of expenditure and more timely data. At the same time, our economies are changing increasingly quickly. We need to keep track of broad concepts of inflation that capture the costs people face in their everyday lives and reflect their perceptions, including measures of owner-occupied housing. This is not about moving the goalposts for monetary policy. It is about future-proofing how we measure inflation. But we also need to recognise that adjustments will present issues in terms of reliability and frequency of the data. Likewise, to get a better sense of the evolution of the HICP over the medium term, we need to complement our analysis also by looking at more cyclical and less volatile measures of inflation, such as underlying inflation. The public rightly expects us to defend the purchasing power of money and that is why we target the overall HICP. But underlying inflation measures are more responsive to economic slack and tend to better predict inflation over the medium term. The relationship between inflation and the real economy If the anchor for inflation is the inflation aim, the Phillips curve – the link between the real economy and inflation – plays a central role in allowing central banks to steer inflation towards that aim. But in the low inflation environment, prices appear to have become less responsive to the real economy. ECB research suggests that the empirical Phillips curve remains intact, but it may be rather flat.[4] Broadly speaking, three factors might explain why inflation responded so weakly to improvements in the economy in the run-up to the pandemic. The first possibility is that economic slack – the amount of underused resources in the economy – was larger than we thought. The second possibility is that the relationship between slack and inflation was obscured by persistent structural forces. And the third is that the anchoring of inflation expectations might have loosened, affecting where inflation settles when both demand and supply shocks have passed and slack converges at zero. The intuition behind the first factor is that the Phillips curve is alive and well, but the euro area faced a series of large shocks that made it harder to measure economic activity relative to potential. Since it is the distance from full employment that matters in terms of moving inflation in the Phillips curve, if that distance is underestimated inflation may remain subdued even as measured slack gets smaller. There are numerous potential causes of this mismeasurement, including: measures of unemployment that ignored the effects of part-time work and underemployment[5]; revisions to potential output which mistook cyclical changes for structural trends[6]; or a failure to fully account for external factors that added to euro area slack, such as relative demand imbalances linked to the trade surplus.[7] Research supports such a role for “hidden slack”. Since 2011, studies that assume that the output gap has been much larger have, in general, outperformed those that use traditional estimates.[8] What is striking, though, is that in the run-up to the pandemic we saw labour market slack diminishing and wages finally rising, but without inflation picking up. In fact, ECB research finds that there was no missing wage inflation in recent years. What we saw instead was a slower pass-through from wages to prices, because companies preferred to compress margins rather than pass on cost rises.[9] For monetary policy, it matters whether firms did this because they expected slowing demand, or because they were affected by persistent structural changes that distorted historical regularities. This brings me to the second factor: long-running structural forces. How could they have weakened the link between the real economy and inflation and thereby require a revised approach to monetary policy? It is clear that globalisation lifted the global labour supply, sharpened competition and caused firms to set prices more strategically. Globalisation also went hand in hand with digitalisation, which increased price transparency and enabled many industries to reduce costs. In theory, all these factors could have depressed price inflation, even as wage growth was being supported through productivity gains from technology. In parallel, adverse demographics in advanced economies may have led to higher saving rates and structurally weaker demand.[10] Research suggests that these forces have affected inflation in the euro area in recent decades. A recent study finds that global factors, such as global commodity prices, global slack and producer price competition, can all significantly affect inflation.[11] ECB research also finds that digitalisation has been disinflationary in the euro area: since 2006, e-commerce has led to an average yearly decrease in non-energy industrial goods inflation of 0.06 percentage points.[12] And empirical evidence suggests that a shrinking working-age population may depress inflation.[13] At the same time, structural forces need not be net deflationary, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. While globalisation and digitalisation have tended to pull in the same direction over the past 20 years, it is conceivable that they might now pull in opposite directions. The pandemic might both trigger de-globalisation – as protectionism rises and firms shorten supply chains to increase operational resilience – and accelerate the expansion of the digital economy. Changing global demographics might also reduce the global labour supply.[14] In addition, a more active countercyclical role for fiscal policy after the pandemic may strengthen inflation dynamics. And we have to factor in a renewed focus on mitigating climate change, too, which could have an impact on inflation through progressive changes in the energy mix as we transition towards a carbon-neutral economy. Climate change affects all aspects of monetary policy: output and inflation, long-term interest rates and policy transmission. That is why we are carefully studying the implications of climate change for our primary objective as part of our strategy review. In any event, structural factors can only have a lasting negative impact on inflation if they seep into inflation expectations. This leads me to the third factor that may explain the apparent disconnect between the real economy and inflation. Empirically, it is not straightforward to gauge the anchoring of inflation expectations. There can be differing interpretations depending on the approach used to define anchoring, as well as the measure and horizon of inflation expectations considered. That said, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have fallen notably, even when adjusted for various risk premia that can distort the picture. Those measures have also become more responsive to short-term news, which can be interpreted as a sign that their anchoring has softened. Survey-based measures remain more or less within a range consistent with the ECB’s aim (i.e. 1.7-1.9%), but they have also moved to the bottom of that range since 2019. For the actual process of setting wages and prices, it is the expectations of the public that matter most. Since our last strategy review there has been more research on how consumers and firms form their inflation expectations. While data are still scarce and noisy, the general picture is that consumers hold very diverse expectations about inflation that appear far less well anchored to our aim than other measures of inflation expectations. In 2015 average perceived inflation among euro area households was just under 5%, while actual inflation was 0.3%. The generally higher level of household expectations is not necessarily a cause for comfort, however. What emerges from the research in this area is that households take a long time to absorb new information on inflation, but when their expectations do adjust they can be hard to dislodge – and the direction in which people perceive inflation to be heading can affect their economic decisions.[15] This process is of course not exogenous to monetary policy: it is greatly influenced by the central bank’s objective and how policy is conducted and communicated in the pursuit of that objective. This is why the discussion about the numerical definition of price stability and the instruments that can support it over time is so important. Clearly, the three factors I have discussed are not mutually exclusive. So it is crucial that we gain a much deeper understanding of their relevance and interactions in order to draw appropriate conclusions for how we conduct our monetary policy. As part of this, we need to understand how they might have interacted with monetary policy approaching the lower bound. This brings me to the final area I would like to discuss today: monetary policy transmission and effectiveness. Monetary policy transmission and effectiveness As monetary policy everywhere has approached the lower bound, all major central banks have faced questions about their policy space and the traction of their tools on the economy. A key challenge has been the long-term fall in estimates of the natural interest rate. The natural rate is the unobservable interest rate that brings desired saving and investment into balance, or to put it another way, that brings output close to its potential. Monetary policy is accommodative when the policy rate is below the natural rate, and restrictive when the policy rate is above it. Estimates for the natural rate in the euro area have dropped from between 0.6% and 2.2% on average from 1999 to 2011, to between -1.3% and 0.5% thereafter.[16] This has required progressively lower policy rates in order to ease monetary policy – or even to prevent an unchanged policy stance from becoming more restrictive. Central banks around the world have shown that this is not a barrier to stabilising the economy. Before the pandemic, the ECB was able to offset the effects of a declining natural rate by taking its deposit facility rate into negative territory and by deploying forward guidance and asset purchases to ease financing conditions at longer maturities. Indeed, asset purchases – by compressing longer-term bond yields – can induce an easing of financial conditions that can partly compensate for the diminishing scope for conventional rate cuts. We also launched a series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) to strengthen the pass-through of these measures via banks to the real economy. The effect on both financial conditions and the real economy was significant. Considering all the measures taken since mid-2014, the overall impact on euro area real GDP growth is estimated to have been between 2.5 and 3 percentage points cumulatively until 2019, and the impact on inflation is estimated to have been between 1.7 and 2 percentage points cumulatively over the same period. The response to the pandemic has provided further evidence of effectiveness. Our pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and the new series of TLTROs have proven to be powerful tools for stabilising financing conditions and stimulating credit growth.[17] According to ECB staff estimates, the measures we have taken since March this year will increase inflation by around 0.8 percentage points cumulatively between 2020 and 2022, and GDP growth by around 1.3 percentage points. However, we have to reflect on what will happen if natural rates remain low and inflation stays subdued – meaning central banks have to continue to resort frequently to balance sheet policies to deliver on their mandates. This scenario throws up two issues that we need to consider more deeply. The first is what should be the standardised toolkit for a world where unconventional policy is “normal”. The implicit assumption since 2008 has been that policy “normalisation” will mean returning mainly to interest rate policy and winding down unconventional policies. But if “normal” is closer to what we saw before the outbreak of the pandemic and, I am afraid, what we are seeing even more vividly now, we need to be prepared. We need to have a clear consensus – agreed within the Governing Council and understood by the public – on what tools are available to us when inflation is too low, and how they should be systematically deployed in response to different types of shock. So we need to further our understanding of the transmission channels of our different instruments, and to evaluate their relative side effects, both intended and unintended, as they work their way through the economy. A central question is the extent to which different tools are substitutes or complements and their potential non-linearities – that is, how their effectiveness might change over time or in different economic conditions. We already have some evidence on substitutability. For example, ECB research finds that without the use of large-scale asset purchases since 2015, our deposit facility rate would have had to fall to around -2% to achieve the same path of inflation we observed. This is a level that would probably have triggered “reversal rate” dynamics, a situation where a rate cut would become contractionary because it harms the business models of financial intermediaries and disrupts monetary policy transmission.[18] Conversely, other instruments have displayed complementarities. Think, for example, of our TLTROs and our negative rate policy. The former have been able to leverage the power of the latter by channelling the stimulative impulse associated with sub-zero rates directly to banks. Unlike in a “reversal rate” scenario, this promotes credit creation – because banks can borrow at very low interest rates under TLTROs only on the condition that they lend on – without hurting banks’ profitability and impairing monetary transmission. The second issue we need to reflect on is interactions between monetary and fiscal policies. When central banks have to use balance sheet policies extensively, there is an inevitable strengthening of the interplay between monetary and fiscal policies. This interaction works both ways. Fiscal policy empowers monetary policy by fostering demand, which brightens economic prospects for firms. This encourages them to borrow and allows them to fully benefit from monetary policy stimulus. And monetary policy makes fiscal policy more effective, because when monetary policy is at the lower bound – and committed to staying there via forward guidance on rates and asset purchases – fiscal multipliers are higher.[19] Indeed, one explanation for the superior inflation performance of the United States relative to the euro area in recent times is that monetary and fiscal policies were more aligned. From 2013 to 2018, fiscal policy in the euro area tightened by around 2.5 percentage points of GDP, compared with a loosening of around 0.8 percentage points in the United States. ECB analysis for the euro area finds that, while monetary policy was supporting inflation during this period, it was being offset by demand headwinds. The implication is that, in the current environment, both policies must remain expansionary for as long as necessary to achieve their respective goals. And, in disinflationary conditions when the economy is running short of its potential, the goals of each policy are naturally aligned. But if monetary and fiscal policies are interacting more closely, it also raises important questions – questions that will become even more acute in the aftermath of the pandemic. These include how to set policy in a world of possibly permanently higher levels of public debt, and the appropriate design of Europe’s fiscal framework. Since restarting our strategy review, we have introduced a new work stream on monetary-fiscal interactions precisely to address such questions. Conclusion Let me conclude. Today I have laid out some preliminary considerations that are guiding our strategy review. At this stage, it is too early to draw any firm conclusions. Rather, I have attempted to identify some of the key issues the Governing Council will aim to address. There is one issue, however, on which I can be decisive today: we must explain much better to the general public what we are doing and why, and we must talk to people that we do not normally reach. This imperative has to cascade through all the elements of our review: our inflation aim, our inflation measure, our tools and their effectiveness, and how we take into account new challenges that people care about, like climate change or inequality. I am fully committed to this vision. Monetary policy can only be credible if we ensure that our goals are truly understood and shared by the people we serve. As an independent central bank, we are and will remain accountable to them. Rostagno, M., Altavilla, C., Carboni, G., Lemke, W., Motto, R., Saint Guilhem, A. and Yiangou, J.

6e3ef7a6db97c0ccbb61e5d460231db8db5e9159,2021-11-19,speech,Commitment and persistence: monetary policy in the economic recovery,Christine Lagarde,,all_ECB_speeches.csv,"SPEECH Commitment and persistence: monetary policy in the economic recovery Keynote speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the 31st Frankfurt European Banking Congress 2021 “From Recovery to Strength” Frankfurt am Main, 19 November 2021 It is a pleasure to speak to you this morning. Today’s conference focuses on adapting to the challenges of the post-pandemic world, which is crucial to ensuring that our economies can emerge from this crisis stronger. But as much as we need to look to the future, we still have hurdles to overcome in the present. We are still in a phase where the economy is reopening and the effects of the pandemic have not yet fully played out. In particular, rising energy prices, supply bottlenecks and the withdrawal of physical distancing measures are causing considerable frictions in some sectors. This is being reflected in high inflation rates, which are likely to increase further until the end of the year. This inflation is unwelcome and painful – and there are naturally concerns about how long it will last. We take those concerns very seriously and monitor developments carefully. In particular, we recognise that higher inflation squeezes people’s real incomes, especially those at the bottom of the income distribution. But to understand what monetary policy should do in the current circumstances, we have to identify the underlying drivers of inflation. Today, I will argue that those drivers are likely to fade over the medium term, which is the horizon that matters for monetary policy. And, because they largely stem from the supply side and energy prices, they will probably slow the pace of the recovery in the near term. Our recent strategy review provides us with a playbook for how to act in such a situation. Our review confirmed that we see negative and positive deviations from our 2% inflation target as equally undesirable. But for inflation to return sustainably to target when interest rates are near the effective lower bound, we need to be persistent in our monetary policy. In particular, we must not rush into a premature tightening when faced with passing or supply-driven inflation shocks. In the words of Abraham Lincoln, “commitment is what transforms a promise into a reality” – and this is the spirit we need to ensure that we reach our 2% target on a durable basis. At a time when purchasing power is already being squeezed by higher energy and fuel bills, an undue tightening would represent an unwarranted headwind for the recovery. However, as positive demand forces in the economy gain strength, the inflation outlook over the medium term is looking better than it did before the pandemic. So, we should continue nurturing these forces by not withdrawing policy support prematurely. Current drivers of inflation in the euro area What are the drivers of inflation in the euro area today? To begin with, there is still some inflation that is purely “mechanical” and results from base effects. Inflation fell dramatically last year during the lockdowns – averaging 0.3% – and that automatically leads to higher inflation this year, because we measure inflation on a year-on-year basis. For example, the Deutsche Bundesbank estimates that the reversal of the German VAT cut last year will add 1.2 percentage points to inflation in Germany in the second half of 2021.[1] But this also means that the same percentage will be subtracted from inflation in Germany in January of next year.[2] The more important drivers of inflation dynamics today are related to the frictions we are seeing as the economy reopens. These frictions are showing up in two main areas: the surge in energy prices and in supply-demand imbalances. First, energy inflation, which was negative from the start of the pandemic until the spring of 2021, shot up to 23.7% in October. This is by far the fastest growth rate since the monetary union began. It contributed 2.2 percentage points – more than half – to overall inflation of 4.1% in October. This surge is linked to the reopening of the economy and the recovery in global demand, as well as other special factors. These include restrictions in OPEC+ oil supply, sluggish US shale oil production and lower gas exports from Norway and Russia. That combination of high demand and supply shortages caused European gas prices to soar to record highs in October this year. Second, supply-demand imbalances are also visible outside of the energy sector, which are pushing up underlying inflation too. This is being reflected particularly in industrial goods inflation[3], which is currently close to its highest level since 1999 and could increase further towards the end of the year. The jump in industrial goods prices is a result of, on the demand side, the pandemic-related switch in consumption patterns from services towards goods – for example, people buying home workout equipment rather than renewing their gym memberships – which has still not fully reversed. On the supply side, manufacturers are facing acute shortages of key inputs, which are then being exacerbated by the “bullwhip effect” – a situation where firms encountering higher demand are placing larger and earlier orders than necessary to ensure goods keep flowing out the door. That ricochets down the supply chain and causes further disruptions and shortages.[4] Services inflation is also displaying similar – if less pronounced – patterns. People are eating out and travelling again, while labour supply has not yet fully normalised and input costs are rising. In particular, we are seeing high job vacancy rates in some contact-intensive sectors, even as the number of people in employment is lower by around half a million than before the pandemic. On the back of these factors, inflation is now broadening in the euro area. The share of items in the core inflation basket with inflation rates above 2% has risen to around 45%. This is much lower than in the United States, where that share is around 75%. The near-term outlook It is hard to predict exactly when the current drivers of inflation will subside. The pandemic is an unprecedented situation, there are lagged effects at play[5] and we have few past regularities to fall back on. Nevertheless, we remain confident that inflation pressures will ease over time. This is because we do not see the conditions in place – either at the economy-wide level or at the sectoral level – for inflation rates above our target to become self-sustained. First, for this to happen, an economy-wide “amplification mechanism” is typically required, where output rises persistently above its potential level, with wages and then prices following. But we do not see these dynamics at work in the euro area today. At present, the euro area is experiencing strong “catch-up” demand, but we do not see excess demand. Aggregate demand is currently below its pre-crisis level. In addition, in the coming months the rise in energy prices will most likely weigh on consumer spending in the euro area more than it does in other major economies, since we are a net importer of energy[6] – although some governments are taking important steps to limit the impact of higher energy prices on the most vulnerable members of society. At the same time, we have no reason to believe that aggregate supply has fallen significantly, causing the output gap to close from above. In fact, the extraordinarily successful policy response in the euro area was designed precisely to preserve our supply capacity.[7] Slack in the labour market is receding but wage pressures have not yet started to emerge. Growth of negotiated wages remains subdued.[8] This is perhaps not surprising if we remember that, over a longer period, we are not in a high-inflation environment: the average yearly inflation from November 2019 to today is not far from 1%.[9] Second, at the sectoral level, the frictions pushing up inflation should be gradually resolved as supply-demand imbalances are ironed out. On the demand side, the large shifts in relative demand, away from services and towards goods, should unwind once the pandemic has passed. Consumption of durable goods surged last year but is now close to its pre-pandemic level. By contrast, consumption of durables in the United States is currently around 30% higher than it was before the pandemic. On the supply side, the eventual resolution of supply chain disruptions should have a self-limiting effect on inflation. Labour supply should also increase once job retention schemes are phased out and some discouraged workers[10] start looking for employment again. So far, while frictions exist in some sectors, we do not see broad-based signs of a skills mismatch in the labour market.[11] In fact, employment in the euro area has been recovering strongly, increasing by 0.9% in the third quarter of this year[12], the second-highest growth rate since 1999. Finally, although the main driver of higher inflation, the price of energy, is likely to stay elevated over the coming months, it should stabilise in the course of 2022 – as it normally has done historically after a sharp rise. Futures prices for oil, gas and electricity point to a decline in the coming period, and gas prices have already fallen by about 21% since their record highs in October. However, prices remain volatile and there is some uncertainty over the longer-run outlook: for example, a global shift away from emission-intensive energy could lead to a sustained demand for gas as a transition fuel, resulting in further periods of price volatility.[13] The outlook for monetary policy over the medium term So, how should monetary policy respond? As I have already indicated, in our strategy review we considered carefully how to respond in circumstances where we face pronounced but passing inflation shocks. Three key elements of our strategy are relevant to the current situation. First, we focus on the medium term, not on current inflation numbers. This is because, for one, monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. So, when inflation pressure is expected to fade – as is the case today – it does not make sense to react by tightening policy. The tightening would not affect the economy until after the shock has already passed. Second, our strategy tailors our monetary policy response to the type of shock we are facing. If we are facing a demand shock, where domestic wages and prices are being pushed up by excess demand, tightening policy can help cool the economy and bring down inflation. A supply shock, however, will tend to push up inflation and depress output. In this situation, tighter monetary policy would only exacerbate the contractionary effect on the economy. Today, we are facing a mixture of shocks, which is partly related to catch-up demand but has a strong supply-driven element too. This is clear from the fact that inflation is rising but growth is losing momentum in the near term, as supply disruptions constrain production and higher energy prices eat into demand. Tightening policy prematurely would only make this squeeze on household incomes worse. At the same time, it would not address the root causes of inflation, because energy prices are set globally and supply bottlenecks cannot be remedied by the ECB’s monetary policy. The third key element of the new strategy is our conclusion that, when coming out of a period of too low inflation where interest rates are close to their effective lower bound, monetary policy has to be patient and persistent. This is because it takes time for stronger inflation dynamics to become self-sustained, and reacting too early to signs of rising inflation can derail that process. We expressed this persistent orientation via our forward guidance on interest rates, where we said that, for rates to rise, we need to see inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of our projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and we judge that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term. These conditions were designed especially to ensure that we do not overreact to supply-driven cost-push shocks that will not persist into the medium term and that, before raising rates, we have a high degree of confidence that underlying inflation dynamics have genuinely improved. As I have recently explained, the conditions to raise rates are very unlikely to be satisfied next year.[14] Moreover, even after the expected end of the pandemic emergency, it will still be important for monetary policy – including the appropriate calibration of asset purchases – to support the recovery and the sustainable return of inflation to our target of 2%. We will announce our intentions in this matter in December. But if we are patient and persistent now, I am confident that these conditions will eventually be met. GDP should reach its pre-pandemic level before the end of this year. Inflation expectations are rising towards our target. Measures of underlying inflation are moving in the right direction. And wage growth, which is a key element of underlying inflation, should start to gradually strengthen. The ECB’s recent contacts with large European companies suggest that wage growth will pick up somewhat next year.[15] Conclusion Let me conclude. We do not take this phase of higher inflation lightly. But in our strategy review we have agreed on how to approach the type of situation we face today. We are committed to ensuring that inflation stabilises at our 2% target in the medium term. Today, inflation is largely being pushed up by the exceptional circumstances created by the pandemic. And the nature of the inflation is likely to slow the pace of the recovery in the near term. Monetary policy today must therefore remain patient and persistent, while being alert to any possible destabilising dynamics emerging. This is the best way to ensure that we return to our 2% inflation target on a sustained basis. Now, we need to follow Abraham Lincoln’s maxim and turn this promise into reality. And if we do, we will escape the low inflation environment of the last decade – and monetary policy will be able to adjust. Deutsche Bundesbank (2020), Monthly Report , Vol. 72, No 11, November.

Here in Estonia inflation has surged as high as 25%. The combination of shocks we are facing – war, energy, disrupted supply chains, re-allocation of demand – means that inflation is likely to stay above our target for some time. In such challenging times, central banks have to rely on their inner compass – their loyalty to their mandate – to ensure price stability. They have to be prepared to take the necessary decisions, however difficult, to bring inflation back down – because the consequences of letting too-high inflation become entrenched would be much worse for everyone. So what does this imply? The answer can be found in the writing of Ragnar Nurkse, to whom this lecture series is dedicated. Though well known for his work on international financial architecture, he also made an important contribution to our understanding of inflation based on the experiences of the interwar years.[1] In particular, he showed that fighting inflation is both complex and simple. Complex because, in times of great volatility, economies can face a series of shocks which produce rising and persistent inflation. Witness the 1920s when inflation was driven, in part, by tumbling exchange rates and acute supply bottlenecks, including for energy. But simple because, in the end, there is only one way that those shocks can lead to sustained inflation – and that is if monetary policy accommodates them and allows them to feed into inflation expectations. As Nurkse wrote, “when a price rise goes on for some time […] it tends to create expectations of a further rise. The point at which such expectations come to be firmly and widely held is a crucial one in the process of inflation. From that point onwards, the process is entirely changed.”[2] Today, we are facing an extremely challenging environment where inflation is being driven by a range of different shocks. But it is monetary policy that will determine whether these shocks lead to lasting inflation. And we will not allow that to happen. We will therefore have to raise rates to levels that will deliver our 2% medium-term inflation target. The ultimate goal of our interest rate path is clear, and we are not there yet. In my remarks today, I would like to explain why we are facing such high inflation and assess the risks of it becoming embedded. But I will argue that with two “Cs” – commitment to our mandate and clarity about our reaction function – we can navigate the challenges successfully and bring inflation back down to our target. The forces driving inflation Since the start of the monetary union, we have not witnessed such a rapid shift in the inflation environment. Headline inflation in the euro area – which was negative as recently as December 2020 – has risen by 11 percentage points from its trough during the pandemic to its level last month. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, has risen by 4.8 percentage points. Three interlocking factors have led to this turnaround: the fact that we are facing repeated shocks; that those shocks are passing through more strongly into inflation; and that they are proving more persistent than in the past due to structural changes in the economy. First, the euro area economy has been hit by an unprecedented series of shocks on both the demand and supply sides of the economy. This has restricted aggregate supply while also directing demand towards sectors with capacity constraints. We have faced pandemic-induced lockdowns, supply chain disruptions, energy production cuts, and Russia’s unacceptable and unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine – all while demand has been shifting back and forth across sectors at speed.[3] Recently, the reopening of the economy has led to a rapid release of pent-up demand, supported by high levels of excess savings. As a result, ECB analysis finds that demand and supply factors are currently contributing more or less equally to core inflation, with demand being more important for services and supply more important for industrial goods.[4] The result has been a large and persistent inflationary shock. Second, we are seeing a faster and stronger pass-through of these shocks into prices. In the past, the pass-through of producer prices to industrial goods inflation typically took around two years and was often partially buffered by profit margins – i.e. firms absorbed some of the cost increases to avoid presenting consumers with large price rises. But ECB analysis finds that, recently, the pass-through to inflation has been taking place much faster, lasting only around half a year. And on average it has been more intense than in the past, with firms maintaining and, in some sectors, even increasing their profit margins. The reason is that when inflation is high everywhere and supply is constrained, firms can more easily pass on cost increases to customers without losing market share to their competitors.[5] All this has meant that external shocks have seeped into underlying inflation – the part of inflation which is typically more “sticky”.[6] Even if some of the drivers can be expected to soften as bottlenecks ease, reopening effects fade out and energy prices stabilise, standard measures of underlying inflation in the euro area now range from around 4% to 8%.[7] The third factor aggravating this situation is the persistence of the shocks due to structural changes in the economy. The shocks triggered by the pandemic and the war have created what I have previously called a “new global map” of economic relationships.[8] And the economic turning points on this new global map imply that some supply constraints are likely to last longer.[9] Two stand out. First, the cut in gas supplies caused by the Russian invasion is a major structural change which will have ramifications for several years. Futures market curves suggest that we will see higher gas prices for a time, as European countries will have to pay a premium to attract uncontracted LNG to replace Russian gas. Substitution effects will probably also increase prices for other sources of energy. Over the longer term, the war is also likely to accelerate the green transition in Europe, including the switch to renewable energy, which should ultimately lead to falling electricity prices. But we could see lower investment in oil and gas production during the transition phase, putting upward pressure on fossil fuel prices while demand for those fuels still remains high.[10] Second, we are seeing changes in the nature of globalisation, and particularly China’s role in it. The supply disruptions created by the pandemic, the vulnerabilities it has exposed and the new geopolitical landscape look set to trigger a reassessment of global value chains. While this will not lead to “de-globalisation”, we can expect geopolitical factors to be re-introduced into supply chains. A recent survey finds that almost 90% of global firms are expecting to regionalise their production over the next three years.[11] This is likely to reduce efficiency and increase costs, which could create inflationary pressures for some time while supply chains are adjusting. At the same time, domestic policy choices in China, as well as US export controls on key technologies, are likely to affect China’s place in the global production network. This could become a profound global supply shock insofar as it leads the country to turn inwards and away from market-oriented reforms. The risk of second-round effects Monetary policy cannot prevent the first-round effects of many of these shocks. But especially when the shocks are persistent, we must ensure they do not produce second-round effects that cause too-high inflation to become entrenched. Since the euro area is a net importer of energy, we are facing a large and unavoidable shock to real income owing to the deterioration in our terms of trade. This terms-of-trade “tax” amounted to around 2 percentage points of GDP in the second quarter of this year.[12] The question that workers, firms and governments confront today is how this burden should be distributed within the economy and over time. Fair burden-sharing between wage income and profit margins is certainly justified. Fiscal policy can help spread the burden across different income groups. At the ECB, given our mandate of price stability, we need to ensure that this process does not lead to an inflationary dynamic. If inflation expectations become de-anchored and engrained in wage negotiations and price setting, that could lead to a wage-price spiral which in turn sustains the de-anchoring. And the result would ultimately be both lower real incomes and higher inflation over time. So how acute is the risk of second-round effects today? There are factors on the horizon which are likely to reduce demand and therefore, all else being equal, make it harder for firms to pass on cost increases into prices. As wholesale energy prices are passed through into retail bills, households are increasingly feeling the squeeze on real incomes and consumption is likely to fall. At the same time, pent-up demand from reopening is fading out. The drawdown of excess savings seems to be already largely counterbalanced by strengthening precautionary motives for saving and liquidity preference.[13] In this context, although recent data on GDP growth have surprised on the upside, the risk of recession has increased. The same is true for Estonia, where Eesti Pank estimates growth to be -0.5% this year. This domestic slowdown might also be exacerbated by the synchronised tightening of monetary policy globally. ECB analysis finds that , since the early 1990s, US tightening has typically lowered industrial production in the euro area by as much as in the United States itself.[14] However, historical evidence suggests that we should not expect slowing growth to make a significant dent in inflation, at least not in the near term. Looking at past euro area recessions going back to the 1970s, we see that headline inflation fell by an average of about 1.1 percentage points one year afterwards, while core inflation fell by about half that amount. Even the additional impact of foreign spillovers on demand will not necessarily lower inflation in the short term. Our analysis finds that US policy tightening tends to reduce euro area inflation in the medium term. But in the near term, inflation will rise if the euro depreciates against the US dollar and commodity prices go up in euro terms. In this context, we are likely to see wages “catching up” to some extent with higher inflation, since the conditions are in place for workers to try to recoup losses in their real income. The labour market has remained resilient so far, with forward-looking indicators showing little sign of weakening.[15] Inflation expectations have been creeping up. In parallel, governments are facing pressures to increase indexation, for instance by tying pensions and public sector wages to inflation, which could add to wage pressures in the private sector too.[16] This outlook is confirmed by evidence from the latest collective bargaining rounds and our corporate telephone survey, both of which point to a rise in negotiated wages next year of around 4%. Here in Estonia, wage growth is currently running at around 10%. These developments do not constitute excessive second-round effects so far, and at longer horizons inflation expectations remain anchored. But with inflation likely to remain high for an extended period, we need to monitor inflation expectations and wage negotiations very carefully to ensure that wage growth does not settle persistently at levels that are incompatible with our target. Commitment and clarity So how should monetary policy be calibrated in this setting to ensure price stability? In my view, two “Cs” are key: commitment to our mandate and clarity about our reaction function. Displaying commitment to our mandate is vital to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored and second-round effects do not take hold. A number of recent decisions by the Governing Council underline our determination in this regard. First, we have been raising rates at our fastest pace ever – by 200 basis points in our last three policy meetings. In this way, we are signalling our resolve to deliver on our target, which should be immediately reflected in inflation expectations. Policy normalisation also withdraws support for demand at times of inelastic supply, which should lead to firms revising down their selling price expectations. Second, we decided last week to amend the terms and conditions of our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III). The TLTRO addressed the need for significant stimulus during the pandemic, strengthening the transmission of rates to the economy via banks. But now the environment has changed completely – and we need to ensure that the lower cost of funding the TLTRO creates for banks does not impede monetary transmission when policy normalisation is required. This complements our previous actions to preserve the orderly transmission of rates to the economy via financial markets, notably flexible reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme and the new transmission protection instrument. While it is true that interest rates remain the most effective tool for addressing the high inflation environment, it is important to signal, as we continuously do in our monetary policy statement, that “we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term inflation target”. In this context, as I explained at last week’s press conference, in December we will lay out the key principles for reducing the bond holdings purchased as part of our monetary policy portfolios. But we need to pair commitment with clarity about our reaction function. In view of the uncertainty we face today, it is no longer appropriate for monetary policy to give detailed forward guidance. Given the complexity of the shocks we are facing, being able to respond to the incoming data is a major advantage. But making policy meeting-by-meeting in a data-dependent way can come at a cost. In particular, market rate volatility is higher in response to news. This is why – rather than guiding markets by giving a specific target for rates – it is important to clarify our reaction function. As stated earlier, we have increased rates by 200 basis points and we expect to raise rates further. Our job is far from being completed. And withdrawing accommodation may not be enough to bring inflation back to our target. How much further we need to go, and how fast we need to get there, will be determined by the following factors. The first and most important is the inflation outlook: we will raise rates to levels that bring inflation back down to our medium-term target in a timely manner. The inflation outlook is forward-looking and incorporates all the different forces we are facing: the outlook for the economy, the persistence of the shocks and the reaction of wages and inflation expectations. Current inflation numbers are relevant insofar as they provide additional insights about the persistence of inflation. The second factor is the corresponding policy stance and its transmission lags into demand and inflation. Monetary policy is inherently forward-looking, as interest rate changes will only reach their full effect over the next year or two. As a result, while the impact of policy decisions will strengthen over time, it will be seen in the hard data only with a time lag. But this lag in transmission and the prevailing uncertainty also means that the rate path ahead will look different depending on the contingencies we face. If we were to see, for example, inflation becoming more persistent and expectations being at risk of de-anchoring, we could not wait until the full impact of the policy measures materialises. We would need to take additional actions until we are more confident that inflation will return to target in a timely manner. There is also another important dimension to clarity: providing clarity about how the intentions of other policy areas will affect the inflation outlook and thereby our policy actions. During the pandemic, the actions of fiscal and monetary policies were naturally aligned. Fiscal policy needed to prevent a catastrophic collapse of employment, and monetary policy had to prevent a steep decline in inflation. Both supported price stability. Today, however, the alignment between policies is not so automatic. With the economy slowing and real incomes falling, fiscal policy could shift towards a more expansionary stance over and above the contribution from the automatic stabilisers. But in a supply constrained environment, that can exacerbate inflationary pressures and force the central bank to tighten policy by more than would otherwise be necessary. This is why we have emphasised the need for fiscal support to be temporary, targeted and tailored. It should be temporary, so that it does not push up demand too much over the medium term. It should be targeted, so that the size of the fiscal impulse is limited and benefits those who need it most. And it should be tailored, so that it does not weaken incentives to cut energy demand. Over time, fiscal policies will have to consolidate – and it will make a difference for inflation whether this is done by reducing transfers and public consumption and raising taxes or, as has often happened in the past, by cutting public investment. As many of the sources of inflation today are on the supply side, government policies that redirect investment to where it is needed will be essential to achieve non-inflationary growth. Conclusion Let me conclude. The environment we confront today is complex. We are facing shocks from various sides, while navigating a new global map that is causing those shocks to persist for longer. But what monetary policy ultimately has to achieve is simple: we must not, and will not, let high inflation become entrenched. We are committed to bringing inflation back down to our medium-term target, and we are determined to take the necessary measures to do so. The more confident the public is that inflation will return to 2% in a timely manner, the smoother the adjustment process will be. As Samuel Johnson wrote, “great works are performed not by strength, but by perseverance”. And we will persevere until we have ensured price stability in the euro area.

Lane,,all_ECB_speeches.csv,"SPEECH The analytics of the monetary policy tightening cycle Guest lecture by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at Stanford Graduate School of Business Stanford, 2 May 2024 Introduction My aim today is to review the ECB’s monetary policy tightening cycle.[1] The tightening began in December 2021 with the announcement of the end date for our net purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), as well as the recalibration and subsequent phase-out of our targeted lending programme. After concluding net purchases under the PEPP in March 2022 and net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) in June 2022, we subsequently normalised our policy rate (the deposit facility rate [DFR] in conditions of abundant excess liquidity) from -0.5 per cent to 2 per cent in the second half of 2022, before raising rates further into restrictive territory during the first nine months of 2023 to a level of 4.0 per cent. We have held the DFR constant at this level over the last five meetings since our last hike in September (Chart 1).[2] This was an especially striking tightening campaign in view of the prevailing highly-accommodative monetary stance, which consisted of very low levels of the policy rate that had been in place over the last decade, the considerable net asset purchasing under the APP since 2015 and under the PEPP since 2020 and the scale and pricing of the targeted long-term refinancing operations. In late 2021, this stance was still expected to be maintained over the medium term: for instance, the median respondent in the December 2021 Survey of Monetary Analysts expected the deposit facility rate to remain in negative territory until the first quarter of 2025 and net purchases under the APP to continue until June 2023. It follows that, relative the path expected in late 2021, the tightening cycle constituted a major surprise. Of course, the underlying driving force for the tightening cycle was the very large surprise increase in inflation, especially in 2022, after the unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine. A defining feature is that a significant component of the stance tightening is expected to be persistent in nature, with rates only expected to descend to the neighbourhood of a more neutral level, while quantitative easing and targeted refinancing operations are not expected to be resumed.

Notes: The cut-off dates for the data used for the €STR forward curves are 17 December 2021, 11 March 2022, 22 July 2022, 16 December 2022, 9 February 2024, and 29 April 2024. The aim of this lecture is to review this tightening cycle from an analytical perspective. The tightening cycle had two basic aims. First, during an extended period in which inflation was far above our target, it was imperative to unwind a monetary stance that would have been too accommodative relative to the rapid shift in expected inflation over the relevant policy horizon. Second, given the scale of the surprise inflation in 2021-2022, it was essential to contain the propagation of the inflation shock through the subsequent price-wage adjustment phases. While corrective waves of price and wage resetting were inescapable, a monetary stance that ensured that demand would be dampened and that inflation would return to the target in a timely manner would be needed to ensure an orderly adjustment phase that did not risk embedding above-target inflation into longer-term inflation expectations. In calibrating the speed and scale of monetary tightening in the context of the post-pandemic recovery and extraordinary surge in energy prices (including due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine), several considerations were paramount. First, lags in monetary transmission were inevitable: it would take time for monetary policy to exert its full impact on inflation. Second, the descent of inflation from its peak would be assisted by the reversal of some of the factors driving the inflation surge: the easing of supply bottlenecks; the likely expansion of energy supply and contraction in energy demand in response to the spectacular increases in oil and gas prices; and the gradual re-normalisation of the economy through the fading out of pandemic-related distortions in sectoral supply and demand patterns. That is, the calibration of monetary policy should take account the temporary nature of some of the shocks, while making sure that these temporary shocks would not convert into permanent inflation through the de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Third, the calibration needed to allow for various types of uncertainty. Along one dimension, there was uncertainty about the intrinsic persistence of the inflation process. In addition to the standard uncertainty about the feedback dynamics by which price increases in one period would trigger subsequent price and wage increases in following periods, the scale of inflation during 2022 also led to shifts in behaviour, with firms switching to more frequent pricing resets. While this added to the intensity of inflation, it also held out the possibility that the overall adjustment process could be front-loaded.[3] Ultimately, the persistence of inflation would turn on the scale of de-anchoring of inflation expectations, which warranted close monitoring. Along a second dimension, there was uncertainty about the strength of transmission of monetary policy in view of possible shifts in the economic, financial and monetary environment. First and foremost, the many years of low inflation and the strategic commitment by central banks to deliver the inflation target over the medium term provided a strong foundation for containing the inflation shock, compared to the costly de-anchoring dynamics observed in the 1970s. Compared to previous tightening cycles, it was also important to take into account trend shifts in: the sectoral composition of activity (which, among other things, can affect the overall degree of price rigidity in the economy, the interest sensitivity of demand and the overall sensitivity of activity levels to domestic demand); the state of the labour market; the scale of leverage among households and firms; the state of the banking system (which had been stabilised following regulatory reforms and intensified supervision with the introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism) in relation to capital levels, the risk profiles of loan books (including due to the beneficial impact of borrower-based macroprudential measures) and bond holdings, together with the risk profile of liability structures; and, finally, structural exposures to interest rate movements (with a substantial increase in the share of fixed-rate mortgages).[4] In addition to trend shifts, the pandemic itself had resulted in lower leverage and more robust balance sheets, due to forced savings during the pandemic and the scale of fiscal transfers to households and firms. Furthermore, monetary tightening could be taking hold at the same time as a projected rebound in economic activity might protect employment levels, with firms holding onto workers in anticipation of post-pandemic normalisation. Working in the opposite direction, Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine had triggered a major increase in economic uncertainty, while the surge in imported energy prices constituted a major terms of trade shock that substantially reduced real incomes and purchasing power: these forces were independently likely to dampen consumption and investment for any given level of monetary restriction. Along a third dimension, the nature of the monetary configuration also created uncertainty about the tightening process. After many years of expanding the central bank balance sheet (which had further accelerated during the pandemic), the required shift in the monetary stance called for an exit from net asset purchases and a pull back from the longer-term refinancing operations that had pumped liquidity into the banking system, in addition to the lifting of the policy rate. In the absence of historical benchmarks for this exit process, there was a wide range of views about the possible impact on the financial system. In addition, since both balance sheet normalisation and the lifting of policy rates were simultaneously proceeding at a global level, there was also uncertainty about the strength of international spillovers in the tightening process.[5] A final uncertainty dimension related to the modelling of monetary policy. The ECB maintains a suite of macroeconomic models in order to provide robust underpinnings for forecasting and policy analysis.[6] The projected impact of shifts in monetary policy varies across these models, in line with differences in the specification of the economic and financial environment and, crucially, in the sensitivity of inflation expectations to policy actions. Taken together, these various types of uncertainty underlined the importance of taking a data-dependent approach to the calibration of monetary policy that would take into account the evolving inflation outlook, the realised path for underlying inflation indicators and the incoming evidence on the strength of monetary policy transmission. I will now provide an analytical review of the transmission of monetary policy tightening to: the financial and banking systems; the economy; and, finally, inflation. I will also briefly draw some lessons from the tightening period for the conduct of monetary policy during the next phase of the cycle. Transmission to financial markets and the banking sector Our policy rate hikes and the phasing out of asset purchases have been passed smoothly to money markets, risk-free rates, risk assets and lending rates by banks.[7] Transmission via market interest rates The money market is the immediate locus in the transmission of monetary policy. Our key ECB interest rates have a direct impact on the rates prevailing in that market, while our balance sheet policies also play an important role. The transmission of the steep increase in our policy rates to unsecured money market rates has been smooth and complete. This is essential for a proper transmission as the euro short-term rate (€STR) and expectations about its future path form the basis of the entire euro area risk-free rate curve: the overnight index swap (OIS) rates. In the secured money market, rates saw some imperfect pass-through in late 2022 as the revaluation of bonds contributed to a temporary scarcity of collateral. Our measures (such as securities lending, cash collateral, and changed remuneration of government deposits) have helped to successfully restore full transmission in that part of the money market as well. As we returned to our policy rates as the primary instruments for steering the monetary policy stance in 2022, the understanding in the market of how we decide the key ECB interest rates has become pivotal again. This understanding contributes to the formation of expectations of market participants about the future path of interest rates and thereby has an immediate impact on medium- to longer-term interest rates, which are particularly consequential for the economy. ECB staff analysis of euro area risk-free rates and inflation-linked swap (ILS) rates suggests that financial markets have rapidly internalised the ECB’s pattern of reaction to changes in the inflation outlook. As a result, the gradual upward shift of the €STR forward curve throughout the tightening cycle (Chart 1) was more than proportional to the upward shift in market-based measures of inflation compensation (Chart 2), bringing real interest rates in the euro area from deeply negative to firmly positive levels. Chart 2: Inflation path and fixings (percentages per annum) Sources: Bloomberg, LSEG and ECB calculations. Notes: “Latest” refers to fixings with a cut-off date of 29 April 2024.The latest observations are for March 2024 for realised HICP (monthly data). When annual HICP inflation stood at 5 per cent in December 2021, markets were still pricing in a steady return of inflation to 2 per cent by the end of 2022. The repeated upward surprises in inflation thereafter caused an upward repricing of risk-free rates and of measures of inflation compensation, yet without signs that markets were misrepresenting our reaction function or that they were expecting inflation to stay permanently high. In fact, the inflation path priced into measures of inflation compensation and ECB staff analysis that seeks to extract the genuine inflation expectations component indicate that longer-term inflation expectations have remained well anchored close to 2 per cent throughout this episode. The continued anchoring of inflation expectations also helps explain another pattern in euro risk-free rates that has caused concerns among some observers: the slope of the risk-free curve – as measured by the difference between the OIS-ILS spread at a ten-year compared to two-year maturity – has been negative for over a year now and even stood at -0.8 in June 2023, a record-low level since the launch of the euro (Chart 3). Historically in the euro area and elsewhere, an inverted yield curve has often preceded economic recessions.[8] While the euro area economy has been stagnating, fears of a deep and long recession have proven unfounded. At the current juncture, the negative slope of the yield curve points to an assessment by markets which is directionally in line with ours: short-term interest rates stand at high and firmly restrictive levels but medium to longer-term rates are lower, as inflation and with it our policy rates are set to decline over time. In other words, the current inversion of the yield curve indicates expectations of an eventual normalisation of inflation towards 2 per cent and of interest rates towards more neutral levels.

Shaded areas indicate periods of euro area recession as defined by the CEPR-EABCN Euro Area Business Cycle Dating Committee. The latest observations are for March 2024 (monthly data). Longer-term risk-free rates increased in the euro area not only on account of higher expected policy rates, but also due to other measures taken by us and central banks globally. In particular, the phasing out of asset purchases has had an additional tightening effect via the decompression of term premia. Since December 2021, more than one third of the 280 basis point increase in the ten-year euro area OIS rate is estimated by our staff to result from an increase in term premia stemming from quantitative tightening and other factors. Indeed, the ongoing reduction (both realised and expected) of the Eurosystem bond holdings has been the main driver behind the increase in sovereign risk premia – and, given the no-arbitrage condition, in risk-free term premia – as duration risk is added back into the market (Chart 4). Chart 4: Impact of APP and PEPP sovereign bonds holdings on sovereign risk premia of the big-4 (basis points) Sources: ECB calculations. Notes: The chart shows the estimated impact of APP and PEPP holdings on the GDP-weighted sovereign risk premium of sovereign bonds for the big-four sovereign issuers (Germany, France, Italy and Spain). Impacts are derived on the basis of an arbitrage-free affine model of the term structure with a quantity factor (see Eser, F., Lemke, W., Nyholm, K., Radde, S. and Vladu, A. L. (2023), “Tracing the Impact of the ECB’s Asset Purchase Program on the Yield Curve”, International Journal of Central Banking). The upper range of the blue area, i.e. the smaller impact estimates are based on the baseline version of the model, while the lower range of the blue area, i.e. the greater impact series are based on an alternative version of the model informed by the yield reactions to the March 2020 PEPP announcement. The latest observations are for March 2024. Our policy tightening has also been reflected in sovereign bond markets, which have coped well with the rapid increase in interest rates. Sovereign bonds serve as a key reference asset to price other bonds and as an important determinant of overall financial conditions within economies. ECB staff analysis also confirms that sovereign stress impairs the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy and eventually to inflation. Looking at the euro area as a whole, GDP-weighted euro area sovereign bond yields have moved largely in lockstep with risk-free rates in recent years. As a result, the ten-year yield spread over the OIS rate has been fairly stable (Chart 5). While the increase in interest rates and the decline of the Eurosystem balance sheet have induced upward pressure on longer-term bond yields, the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), including the in-built flexibility applied to reinvestments, and the transmission protection instrument (TPI) have been important elements in our monetary toolkit. It is plausible that the remarkably smooth transmission of the forceful tightening cycle to the sovereign bond market would not have been possible to the same extent without PEPP flexibility and the TPI. The EU-wide solidarity embodied in the NGEU programme has also played a vital role in reducing risk premia.

Notes: The spread is the difference between individual countries’ ten-year sovereign yields and the ten-year OIS rate. The latest observations are for 29 April 2024. Finally, the exchange rate response has been relatively muted over the tightening cycle. The euro has remained broadly stable against the US dollar(Chart 6). This is largely due to the considerable degree of synchronicity of the tightening cycle.

Notes: The latest observations are for 25 April 2024. Transmission via the banking sector The transmission of the restrictive monetary policy stance to bank lending conditions has evolved over the course of the tightening cycle. In general, the cost of funding for banks depends both on their sources of funding and the term structure of interest rates. Bank bond yields responded quickly to the tightening monetary policy (Chart 7). And while the pass-through from our policy rates to the average rates that banks apply to deposits has been partial and relatively slow, time deposit rates, especially those of firms, have tracked policy rate hikes rather closely (Chart 8). One contributor to the asymmetry in the response of returns on different segments of bank funding to monetary policy was that banks had been reluctant to pass on negative interest rates to their retail depositors during the highly accommodative phase, driving a negative spread between the remuneration of customer deposits and the interest banks were receiving on reserves. As a corollary, banks were initially slow to raise deposit rates in order to restore traditional margins. In addition, the high amount of central bank liquidity and the low demand for credit also limited the pressure to increase deposit rates. Furthermore, a lack of competition in some member countries also reduced the pass through to deposit rates. Over the period since September 2023 in which we have held our policy rates constant, bank bond yields have declined somewhat, in part reflecting the anticipation of future rate cuts, while deposit rates have continued to increase, as competition for deposits intensifies and depositors shift funds from lower remuneration overnight deposits towards more attractive time deposits.

Banks have passed on their increased funding costs to firms and, to a slightly lesser extent, households in mortgage lending (Chart 9). Interest rates on new lending increased rapidly, peaking soon after the last rate hike in September 2023, but have been edging down recently. However, average lending rates on the outstanding stock of loans have continued to increase. This reflects the ongoing transmission of past rate hikes, as loans that were granted in the past at lower rates reprice. Chart 9: Bank lending rates to households and firms (percentages per annum) Source: ECB (MIR) and ECB calculations. Note: Interest rates on new business for firms and households for house purchase refer to the indicator for the total cost of borrowing, which is calculated by aggregating short-term and long-term rates on new business using a 24-month moving average of new business volumes. The latest observations are for February 2024. The annual growth rate of lending to firms and households declined sharply over the tightening cycle but is now also showing signs of stabilisation, albeit at low levels. According to the most recent bank lending survey (BLS), net demand for new bank loans by firms is still declining, as the high interest rate environment keeps external financing costs elevated and the weak growth environment means that firms are postponing fixed investment plans (Chart 10). At the same time, banks reported a modest net tightening of bank credit standards for loans to firms, mainly on account of increased risk perception (Chart 11) Evidence from the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE) is consistent with the weakness in bank lending to firms (Chart 12 and Chart 13). Firms participating in SAFE have reported a continued deterioration in bank loan availability, although this has eased from previous rounds and firms do expect a small improvement in credit supply over the next three months. There has also been a sharp drop in the share of firms applying for a bank loan, a continuation of the trend that began late last year. At the same time, firms signalled less reliance on bank loans, which might reflect sufficient internal funds and/or easier access to non-bank external funding, together with the postponement of investment plans due to a slowing economy or expectations of lower interest rates later this year. Turning to lending conditions to households, the BLS results point to tentative stabilisation in net demand for new loans to households, while credit standards on household mortgages eased for the first time in two years (Chart 14 and Chart 15). Taken together, the information from these surveys is consistent with persistently-weak credit demand and stabilisation in credit supply conditions to firms and households at tight levels.

The net percentages for “Other factors” refer to an average of the further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards. The latest observations are for the first quarter of 2024. In comparison to previous hiking cycles, the flow of credit to firms has declined more quickly since the start of our policy rate hikes (Chart 16). The decline in credit observed so far in the current cycle has been stronger than historical regularities would suggest, based on linear models. The particularly large and rapid increase in policy rates may have amplified the tightening impulse. This may have activated two specific amplification channels operating through bank and firm balance sheets. The first is a risk-taking channel, in which large policy rate hikes increase the riskiness of borrowers, reducing the capacity and willingness to lend.[9] The second is a signalling channel, through which rapid rate hikes might foreshadow a deterioration in future economic conditions, reducing the expected revenues and increasing the expected future funding costs of potential borrowers, leading them to reduce their demand for credit. Staff estimates suggest that the actual contraction in credit has been more in line with a path that incorporates such non-linear effects in transmission operating through bank and firm balance sheets (Chart 17). The availability of liquidity to the banking system is also playing a role in the transmission to bank lending. Estimates by ECB staff suggest that banks with lower excess liquidity are more likely to reduce their supply of credit in response to policy rate hikes, and the increase in their lending rates is likely to be larger (Chart 18). This means that, as aggregate liquidity shrinks, the transmission of our restrictive monetary policy stance to bank lending may strengthen. Finally, institutional factors, such as banking supervision and macroprudential policies, play a significant role in shaping the risk-taking behaviour of banks. Both supranational and centralised bank supervision can reduce unwarranted risk taking by banks, while encouraging lending to better performing firms.[10] Sound macroprudential policies can also complement monetary policy by increasing the resilience of the financial system.[11] Such frameworks, which have been put in place over the past decade, have strengthened the banking sector, and allow for a more orderly transmission of monetary policy, thus reinforcing monetary policy's ability to fulfil its mandate of ensuring price stability.[12] Chart 16: Monetary policy transmission across hiking cycles (x-axis: years; y-axis: cumulative changes in percentage points for the policy rate, and credit growth in deviation from the start of the cycle (t) in percentage points for total credit to firms) Sources: ECB (BSI, CSEC) and ECB calculations. Notes: The relevant policy rate is the Deutsche Bundesbank’s Lombard rate up to December 1998, the ECB’s main refinancing operations rate up to May 2014 and the ECB’s deposit facility rate thereafter. Total credit covers loans and debt securities. Monetary financial institutions loans are adjusted for sales and securitisation and cash pooling. The starting months correspond to the month immediately preceding the cycle’s first hike or the explicit announcement of the hike. Hiking cycles are considered to have begun in: June 1988, October 1999, November 2005 and May 2022. The dotted line shows a counterfactual for lending volumes, taking December 2021 as the latest observation and projecting volumes conditional on the path of monetary policy rates based on the BVAR model in Altavilla, C., Giannone, D., and Lenza, M.

Chart 17: Credit growth in the current hiking cycle through the lens of non-linearity (annual credit growth) Sources: ECB and ECB calculations. Notes: The estimates are based on local projections that are non-linear in the shock sign and magnitude. For each month, the predicted change in credit growth is the sum of weighted, lagged, impulses, where the impulses depend on the size of the policy change, and the weight is the change in the policy rate h periods in the past. The decomposition is achieved by computing the fitted change for the linear model (in yellow), and the non-linear model where only speed or strength is allowed to vary with the size of the rate change. The latest observations are for January 2024.

The specification includes bank and country time fixed effects and controls for bank assets. The size of the bubbles measures the outstanding amounts of loans to firms for banks belonging to each category. The latest observations are for November 2022. Transmission to the economy The restrictive policy stance has also been feeding through to economic activity. Economic activity has been stagnating throughout 2023 and started to recover at the beginning of 2024 (Chart 19). In terms of the demand components, public consumption has been the main consistent driver of growth, while private consumption and external demand have remained subdued in recent quarters. Weak housing investment has been a persistent drag on growth, while business investment has been more resilient until recently, as past order backlogs supported the production of capital goods (Chart 20).

The latest observations are for the fourth quarter of 2023 for investment, the first quarter of 2024 for construction production, March 2024 for PMIs, and April 2024 for European Commission. Our restrictive policy stance has transmitted at different speeds to different parts of the economy. The speed and strength of transmission depends on several factors, including the importance of foreign demand and foreign competition, the reliance on domestic compared to global supply chains, the balance sheets of households and firms, the interest sensitivity of investment and consumption and the state of the labour market. Estimates suggest that the peak impact of our policy tightening on activity levels is larger for manufacturing than for services, with the peak impact occurring in the fourth quarter of 2023, and larger for business and housing investment than for private consumption, with the transmission to business investment strengthening further in the first quarter of 2024 (Chart 21).[13] As the structure of the euro area economy evolves, such sectoral heterogeneity in monetary policy transmission may also alter the impact on aggregate economic activity. For instance, in view of the rising role of services in the euro area, and the slower and weaker response of services output to monetary policy, it is natural to ask whether transmission to the overall economy has become less powerful in terms of its impact on output. ECB staff analysis confirms that a higher services intensity dampens monetary policy transmission to economic activity, but this dampening effect is moderate: the observed increase in the services share of the euro area economy since the launch of the euro is estimated to have reduced the peak effect on output of a monetary policy interest rate increase by just around 10 per cent (Chart 22).[14] Monetary policy tightening also has heterogeneous effects on different types of private consumption. For example, our staff estimate that spending on durable goods and luxury goods declines more than it does on non-durables, services, and necessity goods (Chart 23). Inflation is also found to adjust differently across essential and non-essential items.

Monetary policy is represented by the monetary policy shocks according to the high-frequency monetary policy shock series by Jarociński, M. and Karadi, P. (2020), “Deconstructing Monetary Policy Surprises – The role of Information Shocks”, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, Vol. 12, No 2, pp. 1-43. The shaded areas (dashed lines) represent 95 per cent confidence bands. Non-durable goods also include semi-durable goods. The build-up of household excess savings and the aggregate strength of corporate balance sheets due to the restrictions on mobility and the significant fiscal transfers during the pandemic may have helped to cushion the impact of monetary policy during the early phase of the tightening. The robust labour market has also supported real income and consumption, in view of the sensitivity of household spending plans to the perceived risk of unemployment. The rotation back towards services, particularly contact-intensive and recreation and travel services following the post-pandemic reopening, was also an important driver of the drop in the savings rate in 2022 and 2023.[15] Nevertheless, the sharp increase in inflation has eroded the real value of household and corporate deposits, while the jump in interest rates has generated losses on bond holdings and depressed house prices, thus weighing on financial and non-financial wealth.[16] Moreover, household excess savings accumulated over the pandemic are now concentrated mostly in illiquid assets held by wealthier households, which may not provide a significant boost to private consumption.[17] In addition, profit margins and retained earnings have declined markedly since the start of the hiking cycle and the net interest income earned by firms has fallen.[18] Finally, while consumer confidence has recovered from its extremely low levels in September 2022, which had been triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and surging energy prices, it is still low and well below its long-term average, weighing on spending even as real disposable incomes grow (Chart 24).[19] Chart 24: Private consumption, real disposable income and consumer confidence (left-hand scale: index Q4 2019 = 100, right-hand scale: net percentage balance Sources: Eurostat and European Commission. Notes: The latest observations are for the fourth quarter of 2023 for private consumption and disposable income, and April 2024 for consumer confidence. As reflected in the March 2024 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, we expect growth to recover gradually over the course of this year. Output in the euro area returned to a positive growth rate in the first quarter of 2024 after five quarters of stagnation, while soft indicators, such as the composite PMI for the euro area, point to further positive growth rates in the quarters ahead (Chart 25). The recovery might continue to be characterised by different speeds across sectors. However, as the impact of past monetary policy tightening starts reducing its intensity, the divergence between weak manufacturing and resilient services activity should gradually reduce. The recovery should be supported by declining inflation and further nominal wage growth, which boost real disposable incomes and consumer confidence. A gradual pickup in foreign demand is also expected to support the recovery. Finally, monetary policy should exert less of a drag on demand over time. In line with this, the March projections are also predicated on significant policy easing over the projection horizon (see also Chart 1). Respondents in the most recent survey of monetary analysts (SMA) expect a gradual recovery in GDP in the first half of this year, in line with the March projections, likely reflecting an anticipation of an of an easing in financing conditions. Chart 25: Purchasing Managers’ Index (diffusion index) Source: S&P Global. Note: The latest observation is for April 2024 (flash). Transmission to inflation We have already seen a substantial disinflation from the peak inflation rate of 10.6 per cent in October 2022 (Chart 26). Inflation had started to increase in early 2021 from the pandemic low point of -0.3 per cent in late 2020, rising above the two per cent medium-term target in July 2021, before continuing to climb throughout 2021 and most of 2022. Since late 2022, inflation has come down markedly and the March 2024 ECB staff projections see inflation stabilising around the 2 per cent target from about the middle of 2025 onwards. In fact, inflation has declined more quickly than we had expected. For instance, inflation came in at 2.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, 0.6 and 0.8 percentage points below what was projected back in September 2023, respectively. Slightly further ahead, inflation is expected to continue to be close to our two per cent target. Inflation excluding energy and food is projected to continue declining gradually over the projection horizon, also returning to two per cent in the second half of 2025. Market participants largely agree with this assessment, with the one-year forward inflation-linked swap (ILS) rate at around 2 per cent and the median respondent in the SMA expecting inflation to stabilise at around 2 per cent in the second half of 2025. Chart 26: Inflation projections (annual percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat, March 2024 ECB staff macroeconomic projection and SMA. Notes: HICP refers to headline inflation and HICPX to HICP excluding food and energy. Realised HICP and HICPX are at monthly frequency, and HICP and HICPX projections are at quarterly frequency. Inflation-linked forward swap rates are based on an interpolation of inflation fixings continued by ILS rates. The latest observations for realised HICP and HICPX are for April 2024 (flash estimate); April 2024 round for SMA; March projections cut-off for the inflation-linked forward swap rates (2 February 2024). While overall, the strong disinflation over the past year largely reflects the unwinding in energy inflation (which, in turn, partly reflects large base effects), the easing of pipeline pressures and the relaxation of supply bottlenecks, monetary policy tightening has contributed to the disinflation process by dampening demand and anchoring medium-term inflation expectations at our two per cent target. Inflation has continued to fall in recent months. According to the recent flash release, headline inflation remained stable in April at 2.4 per cent, while core inflation declined to 2.7 per cent from 2.9 per cent in March. Both services and goods inflation declined in April, while energy and unprocessed food inflation increased. Most measures of underlying inflation also continue to ease, although domestic price pressures remain strong (Chart 27).

The latest observations for “standard measures” of HICPX, HICP excluding unprocessed food and energy, and HICP excluding energy are for April 2024 (flash estimate) and March 2024 for the rest. Wage growth is moderating but remains elevated, with recently signed agreements pointing to a slowdown in wage growth to around 4 per cent for the remainder of the year (Chart 28). Firms are also telling us that they expect to raise prices less, with the one year ahead selling price expectations now hovering around 3 per cent, down from 6 per cent a year ago (Chart 29). They also expect slower wage growth over the coming year. This is consistent with evidence from the European Commission, which shows further declines in selling price expectations, which now stand around their mid-2021 levels for most sectors (Chart 30).

So, how has monetary policy contributed to the current disinflation? Monetary policy affects demand and prices through various channels, some that are more direct (via intertemporal substitution) and some that are more indirect (via growth and employment). This means that the full effect of changes in monetary policy on aggregate inflation comes with long and variable lags. In the next section, I will discuss some of the model-implied estimates of the impact that our policy tightening cycle has had on inflation so far, and the expected impacts over the medium-term. However, granular price analysis can also shed light on this question. As consumers rein in their spending in response to a monetary policy tightening, they start by consuming fewer goods with a high intertemporal elasticity of substitution, such as non-essential items and durables. They may also reduce spending on goods that are more interest-rate sensitive, such as durable goods purchased using credit. Analysis by staff suggests that the price response of items most sensitive to monetary policy shocks, which tend to include durables and non-essential items, is around three times larger than for less sensitive items (Chart 31). Finally, the price reaction to monetary policy shocks of these more sensitive consumer items has been stronger in the recent tightening cycle than is past episodes of monetary restraint, reflecting the effectiveness of the steep and decisive hiking policy in dampening demand. Given the differential output impact of monetary policy across manufacturing and services that was discussed in the previous section, we may also expect a differential impact on sectoral inflation. Indeed, the share of items that are highly sensitive to monetary policy shocks is higher for goods than for non-tradable services, while inflation reacts less to monetary policy shocks in countries that are more intensive in services intermediates.[20] For example, if prices in the traded sector (predominantly capital intensive manufacturing) are largely exogenous and driven by world prices, then monetary policy may have larger output effects but small price effects. The inverse may be true in the non-traded sector (predominantly services) where the combination of imperfect competition and price rigidities may give rise to stronger price effects of monetary policy via the real economy. Pinning down these differences empirically can be challenging in light of the diverse composition of these two sectors and confluence of other (potentially countervailing) channels.

(2019), controlling for lags of the dependent variable, EuroStoxx index, industrial production, nominal effective exchange rate, oil prices, producer prices, as well as three-month and one-year Euribor rates. Estimation samples based on an expanding window approach are: (i) pre-COVID (December 2000-December 2019); (ii) including COVID (December 2000 – December 2021); and (iii) including monetary policy normalisation and tightening (December 2000 - September 2023). All impulse responses are normalised to 25 basis points increase in the monetary policy proxy. The next phase of the disinflation process is likely to be more gradual, with bumps in the road ahead. We expect headline inflation to decline more slowly than it has done so far, largely on account of positive base effects, including the expiration or retirement of fiscal measures taken in the past to dampen the surge in energy prices for consumers and firms (Chart 32).

A key role of monetary policy in the disinflation process has been to ensure that the large and persistent but temporary inflation shocks did not translate into an increase in the medium-term inflation trend through the de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Overall, longer-term inflation expectations have remained well anchored throughout the tightening cycle. The anchoring of longer-term expectations and the expectation that inflation would return to target in a timely manner has been supported by the speed and magnitude of the monetary policy response. The expectations curve from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) has remained downward sloping throughout the inflation surge (which was also the case for consumers), meaning that the spike in inflation was not expected to persist and long-term expectations remained broadly stable (Chart 33). The right tail in the distribution of long-term inflation expectations in the SPF has diminished markedly compared with the peak inflation phase in late 2022 (Chart 34). The inflation risk premium embedded in five-year-on-five-year inflation swaps has declined by about 40 basis points since last summer (Chart 35). We have also seen a decline in the inflation expectations at the medium-term horizon reported by firms and households from both the SAFE and CES results (Chart 36).

In providing a complete account of the role of monetary policy, it is simply not feasible in empirical studies to have full control over various confounding factors that contribute to output and inflation dynamics. Accordingly, one role for counterfactual analysis is to isolate the contribution of monetary policy tightening in the disinflation process. Estimates from our suite of macro models suggest that the monetary policy tightening that has cumulated since 2022 and is expected to continue to transmit through 2026 is detracting, on average, around 2 percentage points yearly from both GDP growth and inflation, relative to the counterfactual simulated path in the absence of policy action (Chart 37).[21] In addition, these simulations suggest that, while the impact on GDP growth from our cumulative action might have reached its maximum level in 2023, the bulk of the impact on inflation is comparatively backloaded, with substantial pass-through still expected to transpire in the period ahead. In this quantitative model-based analysis, the calculation of the monetary policy impact abstracts from the role that the strong policy response to the surge in inflation has had in ensuring that inflation expectations have remained broadly anchored. That is, the policy impact would be even stronger if the models also assigned a role for monetary policy in maintaining the anchor. Chart 37: Impact of monetary policy tightening according to a suite of models (percentage points) Source: ECB calculations based on the NAWM II model (see Coenen, G. et al., op. cit.), the MMR model (see Mazelis, F. et al., op. cit.) and the ECB-BASE model (see Angelini, E. et al., op. cit.). Notes: This chart reports the results of a simulation involving changes to short-term rate expectations between December 2021 and March 2024 and changes to expectations regarding the ECB’s balance sheet between October 2021 (to account for anticipation) and May 2023. The reported values refer to year-on-year growth rates. “Mean” denotes the average across the six model variants. Chart 38 illustrates a model-based exercise on the development of upside de-anchoring risks under the actual interest path during the hiking phase (blue bars) and a counterfactual analysis where the rate is assumed to have remained on the path underlying the December 2021 projections (yellow bars). De-anchoring is defined as a situation where medium-term inflation expectations deviate from the ECB’s 2 per cent inflation target. The analysis of the risks of de-anchoring are based on stochastic simulations around the projections of a regime-switching dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. In the anchored regime, the perceived inflation target is in line with the actual 2 per cent target. In contrast, in the de-anchored regime, inflation expectations are driven by past and current inflation realisations, even though the central bank continues to pursue the unchanged 2 per cent target. Chart 38 shows that, due to the tightening of monetary policy, the credibility of the central bank has been maintained by containing upside de-anchoring risks. If rates had been kept at the level of December 2021, the risks would have increased considerably. Chart 38: Risks of de-anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations (percentage risk of upside de-anchoring) Source: ECB calculations based on Christoffel, K. and Farkas, M. (2024): The Risks of De-anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations (mimeo). Notes: The bars show the risks of upside de-anchoring for the December 2023 projections and a ‘no-normalisation’ counterfactual where the rate expectations remain on the path underlying the December 2021 projections. 2024, 2025 and 2026 refer to the projections according to the December 2023 projections. The simulations are based on a regime switching version of the NAWM I Christoffel, K., Coenen, G. and Warne, A. (2007)), where the credible regime is defined as the estimated version of the NAWM-I, with a fixed inflation target, the de-anchored regime is characterised by a time varying inflation target. Upward de-anchoring is defined as a situation where the de-anchored simulation path is above the baseline inflation path. The share of de-anchoring is based on 1000 simulations over a nine-quarter evaluation horizon. A second role for counterfactual analysis is to probe whether alternative tightening paths might have out-performed the tightening path we adopted. Chart 39 reports a set of alternative policy simulations, based on two macroeconomic models of the euro area (the MMR model and the NAWM-II model), which allow the derivation of policy rate paths that are conditionally optimal in the context of the models, given the different information sets available to policy makers regarding the path for inflation and the output gap at different points in time.[22] The models suggest that, if the ECB had perfect foresight on the path that inflation and output would follow subsequently, we should have started hiking in the fourth quarter of 2021, raising the policy rate to between 4.5 and 6 per cent by mid-2023, depending on the model used (black dotted lines in Chart 39). Under this earlier and more aggressive tightening path, inflation would have peaked at around 7 per cent, roughly 3½ percentage points below the actual inflation peak in October 2022. However, the associated output losses would have been severe. This result derives from the fact that the model attributes welfare losses to (squared) deviations of inflation from the target, output from potential, as well as interest rates from the equilibrium value. In that context, to some extent, the model finds it optimal to tolerate a large recession to reduce peak inflation. Along this line, the MMR model estimates that, to achieve this lower inflation profile, output would have needed to decline by 5 per cent below the baseline by the end of 2022, while the NAWM-II model shows that the economy would have needed to contract by 2 per cent in early 2022 and continue contracting for over a year. Of course, the ECB did not have perfect foresight as to the future path of inflation and output: there were large forecast errors in 2021 and especially 2022, with a prominent role for the unexpected surge in energy prices and, relatedly, food prices.[23] Chart 39 also shows the updates to the model-based optimal policy paths that were triggered by the updates to the macroeconomic projections between December 2021 and December 2023, illustrating the high sensitivity of these paths to revised beliefs about the projected paths for inflation and output. In very broad terms, the revisions to the policy path followed by the ECB have been directionally similar to the revisions to such optimal policy paths. Chart 39: Optimal policy counterfactuals (left panel: percentages per annum; middle panel: year-on-year percentage changes; right panel (top) percent of output gap relative to baseline; right panel (bottom) quarter-on-quarter percentage changes) MMR NAWM Notes: The optimal policy rate path simulations beyond the first quarter of 2024 are not shown for confidentiality reasons. “Actual” denotes historical data (DFR for the MMR model and €STR for the NAWM II). The other dashed lines on the left graph are a sequence of optimal policy counterfactuals computed in real time at each projection vintage from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2023. The “With hindsight” lines denote the optimal policy counterfactual computed in the fourth quarter of 2021 with the benefit of hindsight by assuming that the same information that we now have on subsequent inflation and output developments and projections in the March 2024 ECB projections was already available in the fourth quarter of 2021. The middle and right panels show implied inflation and output gap respectively. For MMR: The output gap is in deviation from baseline output gap in the relevant vintage. For NAWM: The figure depicts the optimal policy counterfactuals carried out using the New Area Wide Model (NAWM) II (see Darracq Pariès, M., Kornprobst, A., and Priftis, R (2024)) at different points in time conditional on quarterly real-time macroeconomic projection baselines of the ECB between the fourth quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2023. It is also useful to expand the counterfactual analysis to take into account that the run-down of our securities portfolio has contributed to bringing inflation back to target. Optimal policy rate simulations in the MMR model show that our decisions regarding the securities portfolios and the associated change in expectations since the start of policy normalisation have been equivalent to an average of 30 basis points in rate increases between the first quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2026.[24] A similar analysis using the NAWM II model suggests that, compared to the case where the short-term interest rate is the sole policy instrument, an optimal policy mix, which considers changes to both the interest rate and the central bank balance sheet starting in the third quarter of Q3 2022, would have called for an unwinding of the central bank balance sheet by an additional 4 percentage points of GDP by the end of 2027, compared with expectations for the balance sheet path at the time, and a policy rate that is lower by around 10 basis points throughout the simulation horizon.[25] This optimal combination of policy instruments would have contributed towards marginally lower inflation and higher output, compared with the case where the short-term rate is the only available instrument. A third role for counterfactual analysis is to examine the implications of uncertainty (as captured by alternative scenarios) for the conduct of monetary policy. In particular, since multiple dimensions of uncertainty are relevant, it is desirable to probe the robustness of monetary policy across a range of scenarios. For instance, taken in isolation, uncertainty about the persistence of inflation (for example, think of a scenario in which the feedback of wage inflation to price inflation could be stronger than expected) would call for a more aggressive monetary policy response to above-target inflation. However, also taken in isolation, uncertainty about the strength of monetary policy transmission would call for a more attenuated monetary policy response. In order to think about the performance of a given monetary policy option across these different scenarios, it is useful to inspect model-based robustness exercises. Such counterfactual robustness exercises are routinely carried out by staff at the ECB. For instance, it is helpful to view the calculation of a “minimise maximum regret” criterion that minimises the worst-case welfare loss across various scenarios, with staff running simulations on the basis of a range of possible model-based loss functions that attaches weights to deviations of inflation from the target and deviations of output from potential output. When inflation is projected in the baseline to be not too far above the target, it turns out that “inflation persistence uncertainty” dominates only if the loss function puts zero weight on output losses, whereas “monetary transmission uncertainty” dominates if the loss function puts some weight on output losses. This is because the output losses under a more aggressive monetary policy response, if transmission turns out to be stronger and inflation declines more quickly than expected, outweigh the losses under a more attenuated monetary policy response if inflation turns out to be more persistent.[26] Another type of robustness exercise is to examine the conduct of monetary policy under alternative modelling assumptions. For instance, as indicated earlier, it is evident that the large shocks in 2021 and especially 2022 triggered an increase in the frequency of price adjustment. Current work in progress by a team of economists from different central banks develop an optimal policy analysis that allows for a shift toward more frequent price changes in response to large shocks.[27] Under their approach, an increase in the frequency of price changes represents both an extra cost from high inflation (since there are economic costs – including management costs – from adjusting prices more frequently) but also an opportunity: if price setters understand that the central bank is committed to returning inflation to the target in a timely manner through an aggressive interest rate response to the large shock, the phase of intense inflation will be shorter and the sacrifice ratio in terms of lost output will be lower since price setters only have to focus on adjusting prices to the cost shock rather than also having to incorporate an excessively-prolonged aftershock phase of second round effects. In turn, the anticipation of the monetary policy response helps to reduce the scale and duration of inflation response to the large shock. Of course, while such model-based, staff-led robustness simulations help to provide some analytical underpinnings in reviewing policy options, many factors feed into the overall risk assessment of policymakers in making a rate decision. During the tightening cycle, the hierarchy of the various dimensions of uncertainty has shifted across different phases. For instance, in the first half of 2022, uncertainty about the impact of the sharp shift in the expected path for the balance sheet with the end of net asset purchases (from a scale above €1 trillion in 2021) motivated a step-by-step approach to the phasing-out of quantitative easing, especially in the context of a similar shift by other central banks. The high economic damage envisaged in the alternative scenarios considered in March 2022 in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also motivated a gradual approach to the initial adjustment in the monetary stance in the first half of 2022. For instance, the optimal policy simulations in the MMR and NAWM-II models for the adverse downside scenario based on the escalation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine published with the March 2022 projections prescribed a less responsive policy path compared to the baseline.[28] By the same token, the very sharp rise in actual and projected inflation in the course of 2022 put a premium on guarding against the de-anchoring of inflation expectations and motivated an accelerated approach to monetary tightening between July 2022 and March 2023, with the policy rate being raised by 350 basis points over six meetings. This acceleration took place in the context of a considerable decline in transmission tail risks in view of the observed smoothness of the exit from quantitative easing and the reassurance provided by the announcement of the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) in July 2022. The March 2023 meeting also signalled a shift to a more granular approach to calibrating the level of restrictiveness, with the four subsequent meetings moving rates up in 25 basis point increments. Moving to a lower incremental pace reflected the reduction in inflation uncertainty (inflation had declined markedly from the October 2022 peak) and the increase in uncertainty about monetary policy transmission in view of the mounting evidence of a sharp slowdown in credit dynamics and in recognition of the time lags before the full impact of the accumulated hikes could be observed. The final hike at the September 2023 meeting also incorporated risk management considerations. In particular, in view of some signs of an increase in inflation risks over the course of the summer, it was judged to be safer to increase the policy rate by a further 25 basis points to 4.0 per cent. This additional hike would reinforce progress towards the target for two basic reasons. First, if the economy evolved in line with the staff baseline case, the decision to hike would bolster confidence that inflation would return to target within the projection horizon. Second, a higher interest rate would more strongly limit the amplification of any upside shocks to the inflation path. In consequence, a more secure pace of disinflation and greater insurance against upside risks would also reinforce the anchoring of inflation expectations, which remained a precondition for the disinflation process to keep up its pace. The next phase: reducing the level of restriction In line with our assessment at the April monetary policy meeting, this review of the tightening cycle, together with the observed disinflation path in recent months and the analysis of the drivers of inflation over the projection horizon, indicates that, based on the three elements of our reaction function we can conclude that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that are making a substantial contribution to the ongoing disinflation process. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary. If our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. Subject to maintaining sufficient confidence in the sustained convergence of inflation to our target, the appropriate speed and scale of the reduction in the level of restriction will need to take into account several factors.[29] First, given the lags in transmission, the tightening effects from our past interest rate hikes are still unfolding. The simulations shown in Chart 37 suggest that, while the impact on GDP growth from our cumulative action might have reached its maximum level in 2023, the bulk of the impact on inflation is comparatively backloaded, with substantial pass-through still expected to transpire in the period ahead. Second, as we continue along the disinflation path, the evolution of inflation expectations also has implications for the calibration of monetary policy restriction. As expectations of future inflation normalise further, leaving nominal rates unchanged implies a mechanical increase in real interest rates. For instance, if it were deemed appropriate to keep interest rates stable in real terms, nominal rates would need to decline in line with inflation expectations. In turn, this would reinforce the normalisation of inflation expectations and help to keep longer-term expectations of inflation well anchored at target. Third, there are two-sided risks in proceeding through the next phase. In one direction, easing policy too soon or proceeding too quickly would not be consistent with inflation sustainably returning to target if inflation turns out to be more persistent than anticipated. In the other direction, keeping rates overly restrictive for too long could push inflation below target over the medium term and incur excessive side effects in terms of sacrificed output, employment and investment. This would require corrective action through a subsequent acceleration in rate cuts that could even require having to descend to below-neutral levels to fix any persistent drift towards a below-target inflation trend. In navigating these risks, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. This approach has served us well in the tightening cycle and many of the same considerations will apply during the unwinding phase. In particular, we will have to balance the merits of forecast-based criteria that might call for front-loaded rate cuts versus data-dependent criteria that might call for a gradual and sequential approach, in view of the remaining uncertainty around the degree of persistence in inflation dynamics. Since the relative strengths of these opposing considerations are continuously evolving, a meeting-by-meeting approach maximises policy optionality. A data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach is the best way to ensure that the calibration of monetary policy incorporates the multiple dimensions of uncertainty that have been highlighted in this lecture. Each quarterly projection meeting provides comprehensive staff updates on the inflation outlook, underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission. In turn, while the staff projections are based on the market yield curve, the information at the quarterly meetings provides the foundations for an array of simulations of possible future rate paths, including optimal policy exercises as shown in Chart 39 and “robust” paths that seek to minimise the risk of a policy error across a range of plausible scenarios. While this family of possible future rate paths provides helpful guidance to the Governing Council, the robust approach to making rate decisions under conditions of high uncertainty is to avoid pre-commitments or creating unwarranted expectations about the future rate path. In particular, moving from one meeting to the next meeting and from one projection round to the next projection round allows for the accumulation of further data that can help inform the rate decision. For instance, the net interpretation of the incoming data at a non-projection meeting can result in several possible outcomes: (i) the confirmation of the quarterly assessment; (ii) a further boost to the level of confidence in the sustainability of convergence to the target and/or increased evidence of adverse economic side effects from the level of restriction; (iii) a decline in the level of confidence in the sustainability of convergence to the target and/or increased evidence of economic resilience despite the level of restriction. These outcomes differ markedly in terms of the implications for a rate decision at a non-projection meeting. Accordingly, it is best not to commit to a pre-set path for rate decisions and preserve optionality. Conclusion To conclude, the tightening cycle has ensured that the disinflation process has not been derailed by the de-anchoring of inflation expectations, with the sustainable return of inflation to our target underpinned by a dampened-demand environment. We consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that are making a substantial contribution to the ongoing disinflation process. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary. If our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. In any event, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.

Variation across the euro area in the importance of fixed-rate mortgages was identified since the beginning of the euro as a source of transmission heterogeneity, as emphasised by Dornbusch, R., C. Favero and F. Giavazzi (1998) “Immediate Challenges for the European Central Bank,” Economic Policy 13(26), 15-64. In addition to this cross-country variation, there was a trend increase in the share of fixed-rate mortgages during the pre-pandemic low interest rate period. While fixed-rate mortgages transfer the interest rate exposure away from the mortgage borrower to the holders of interest-sensitive assets, it is plausible that the mortgage borrowers have higher marginal propensities to consume.

While I focus on banks in this lecture, clearly non-bank financial intermediation also plays a role in the transmission of monetary policy. Since 2009, the importance of banks in euro area financial intermediation has declined in favour of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). Direct lending by NBFIs to the private sector is relatively small in the broad euro area, with notable exceptions concentrated in few countries. But those institutions play a dominant role in holding both sovereign and corporate bonds and their balance sheet has steadily increased since the global financial crisis. Hence, since the global financial crisis, the reduction in the relative role of loans over bonds has translated into a diminished importance of banks in monetary transmission compared with NBFIs. Recent research demonstrates that monetary policy transmission via traditional banks and NBFIs differs in non-trivial ways but remains effective in the face of a changing monetary toolkit and evolving central bank mandate.

All else equal, the surprise surge in inflation also reduced the real value of outstanding debt, with the net impact on debtors depending on the degree of exposure to asset price declines. Of course, the near-term cash flow positions of debtors depends on whether the debt is fixed-rate or floating-rate.

Differences in the sensitivity of sectoral inflation rates to monetary policy may also depend on differential exposure to international competition. For example, if prices in the traded sector (predominantly capital- intensive manufacturing) are largely exogenous and driven by world prices, then monetary policy may have large output effects but small price effects. The inverse may be true in the non-traded sector (predominantly services where domestic demand plays a larger role in determining prices). The simulations are carried out using the NAWM II model.

Tenreyro (2023), The art and science of patience: relative prices and inflation, Geneva Report on the World Economy 26. This finding is based on an ex-post analysis using optimal policy counterfactuals under two different sets of assumptions. In a first exercise, the policymaker is assumed to be aware of realised macroeconomic developments and forecasts as captured by the ECB projections from March 2024, but is able to implement an alternative rate path already from the start of the policy normalisation in 2021Q4. The rate path follows optimal policy based on a loss function that takes the following variables into account: deviations of inflation from the target; the output gap; interest rate smoothing. The relative weights on these variables are estimated using euro area data. In a second exercise, optimal rate policy is conducted under the counterfactual assumption that the securities portfolios evolved according to expectations prior to the announcement of policy normalisation at the December 2021 GovC rather than according to their actual evolution. Due to the higher balance sheet and associated macroeconomic dynamics, the optimal rate path in the second exercise is 30bps higher on average over the period 2022Q1 to 2026Q4. Optimal policy counterfactuals under commitment in 2022Q3 are computed conditional on the December 2023 macroeconomic baseline and a central bank loss function, which beyond penalising deviations of inflation from target and deviations of GDP from potential, it also includes penalties on asset holding and interest rate and balance sheet volatility. The penalties of the loss function are calibrated such that under optimal balance sheet policies in March 2015, the path produced by the model is consistent with announcements on asset purchases by the Governing Council as of March 2015. These robust control exercises use three models: MMR model (Mazelis, Motto, Ristiniemi, 2023), the New Area-Wide Model (Coenen, Karadi, Schmidt, Warne, 2019), and the BASE model (Angelini, Bokan, Christoffel, Ciccarelli, Zimic, 2019). A weight of 0.25 on the output gap follows the literature (Kiley and Roberts, 2017) and practice in other policy institutions (Yellen, 2012). These values are consistent with a relative weight on unemployment rate deviations from its natural rate of 1 (Svensson and Tetlow, 2015; Debortoli et al., 2019) and an Okun’s law coefficient of 0.5 that relates the output gap to the unemployment gap. The robust control approach avoids the policy paths that would deliver the largest losses. P. Karadi, A. Nakov, G. Nuno, E. Pasten and D.

I will then discuss in more detail the transmission of our monetary policy in the current environment and the sources of uncertainty that appear particularly relevant at this stage. The outlook for inflation and growth in the euro area Economic activity broadly stagnated over the first half of the year and is likely to remain subdued in the coming months. Weaker foreign demand and tight financing conditions are dampening growth, especially in the manufacturing sector. The services sector, which had been resilient so far, is now starting to “catch down” to manufacturing. The labour market remains resilient despite the slowdown in activity, with the unemployment rate standing at its historical low of 6.4 per cent in August. However, there are signs that labour market momentum is slowing as the economy weakens. The employment Purchasing Managers’ Index declined significantly between the second and the third quarters of 2023, despite a slight uptick in September. The services sector, which has been a major driver of employment growth since mid-2022, is now also creating fewer jobs. In September ECB staff revised down projected GDP growth, particularly for this year and next, due to a greater contractionary effect from tightening financing conditions and the weakening international trade environment. Beyond the near term, ECB staff expect growth to recover owing to higher real disposable income thanks to rising wages and falling inflation, which is set to underpin spending. ECB staff now expect the euro area economy to expand by 0.7% in 2023, 1.0% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. Inflation fell markedly from its double-digit peak last October, with the headline rate having declined to 4.3% in September (flash estimate). In the coming months, the sharp increases recorded in the autumn of 2022 will drop out of the yearly rates, lending further support to a deceleration in inflation. At the same time, underlying price pressures remain strong, although most measures of inflation have started to ease thanks to aggregate demand and supply becoming more aligned and lower energy prices in recent months being passed on to other parts of the economy. Labour costs are increasingly contributing to domestic inflation, while the latest data indicate that the contribution of profits fell for the first time since early 2022. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2%, but the increase in some indicators needs to be closely monitored. The September ECB staff macroeconomic projections see average inflation at 5.6% in 2023, 3.2% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025. Compared with the June Eurosystem staff projections, this is an upward revision for 2023 and 2024 – which mainly reflects a higher projected path for energy prices – and a downward revision for 2025. ECB staff have revised down slightly the projected path for inflation excluding energy and food, to an average of 5.1% in 2023, 2.9% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. This is on account of tighter financing conditions – which also reflect the restrictive impact of our monetary policy tightening – and a weaker economic outlook. The ECB’s monetary policy response In summary, while inflation continues to decline, it is still expected to remain too high for too long. The ECB is determined to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. In order to reinforce progress towards this target, we decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at the September meeting of the Governing Council. This decision was informed by the three legs of our reaction function: first, the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data; second, the dynamics of underlying inflation; and third, the strength of monetary policy transmission. Having raised interest rates by a total of 450 basis points since July 2022, we consider that the key ECB interest rates have now reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to our target. Our reaction function will continue to serve as the framework for future decisions, and we will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of a restrictive monetary policy stance. Uncertainty regarding the transmission of monetary policy As part of this data-dependent approach, we continually assess how monetary policy is transmitted to financing conditions, the real economy and, ultimately, to inflation. In the current hiking cycle, the first leg of monetary policy transmission – to financing conditions – has been very strong. Compared with previous hiking cycles, firms’ lending rates have increased at a faster pace and credit volumes have weakened more markedly. Transmission to the bank lending channel is likely to continue unfolding as lenders may become more prudent in light of rising funding costs and a slowing economy. Moreover, interest rates on outstanding debt will continue to increase as loans are progressively repriced. All in all, in my view, the transmission of our policy tightening to financing conditions seems to be well underway. The second leg of transmission relates to the way in which changes in financing conditions will affect economic activity, as firms and households adjust their plans for consumption, investment and savings accordingly. The transmission of monetary policy tightening to the real economy is proceeding at a slower pace, with a substantial share of the transmission still in the pipeline. For example, real estate activity has slowed down amid the weakening of property valuations. For the economy as a whole, model-based estimates continue to suggest that, owing to the typical lags in monetary transmission, the bulk of the impact of our tightening is expected to materialise only in the course of this year and thereafter.[1] The downward impact of our tightening so far on GDP and inflation is estimated to average around 2 percentage points over the 2023-25 period, with the strongest effect expected on GDP growth this year and on inflation over the next two years. It is also worth noting that the speed of transmission varies across the euro area. In particular, the transmission to households is likely to be faster in countries where variable rate mortgages predominate over mortgages at fixed rate. At the same time, uncertainties regarding transmission remain, mainly in relation to two sources. First, the current hiking cycle is unprecedented in speed. Moreover, it follows a long period of accommodative monetary policy and was accompanied by the recalibration of balance sheet policies, all of which limits comparability with historical regularities. Second, the tightening of our policy stance occurred in reaction to an unprecedented constellation of shocks hitting the euro area over the last three years, which had a disruptive effect on economic conditions and the inflation environment. The fact that we are still confronted with the overlapping legacy effects of these shocks may imply that monetary policy transmission is proceeding differently this time around compared with what historical regularities might suggest. The euro area and the world economy are also exposed to a variety of risks that accompany this monetary policy tightening. Based on our latest assessment, risks to economic growth in the euro area are tilted to the downside. Growth could be slower if the effects of monetary policy are more forceful than expected or if the world economy weakens at a faster pace than currently projected, owing, for example, to a continued slowdown in China. This may, in turn, dampen domestic economic activity and encourage firms, banks and households to be more cautious, thereby putting a strain on bank credit supply, investment and consumer spending. The tightening impulse may be transmitted more forcefully to the real economy in an environment of this kind owing to acceleration effects that often operate during periods of subdued growth and high uncertainty.[2] Conversely, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty mean that people and businesses become more confident and spend more. On the inflation side, weaker demand owing to the stronger transmission of monetary policy or the worsening of the international economic environment could put stronger downward pressure on prices than currently expected. Conversely, renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food – with oil prices having already increased in recent months – and the unfolding climate crisis could push commodity prices up by more than expected. The role of wage dynamics and fiscal policy are of great importance in determining the future path of inflation. Wages have been catching up; elevated wage growth is therefore embedded in our projections, albeit at a decelerating pace. But a lasting increase in inflation expectations above our target owing, for instance, to higher-than-anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. Similarly, as the energy crisis fades, governments are rolling back the fiscal support measures implemented during the crisis. But a slower rollback of this fiscal support or an expansionary fiscal policy stance in the coming years would pose significant challenges to taming inflation and bringing it back to our target. The challenging macroeconomic environment requires a consistent mix of monetary and fiscal policies, with greater risks to price stability if these policies pull in opposite directions. Conclusion To conclude, while we can be sure that our monetary policy tightening is transmitted forcefully to financial markets and is increasingly leaving a footprint in the real economy, the speed and scope of the transmission remain uncertain. This is partly due to the still-fluid economic environment in which we are navigating, with the outlook for inflation and economic activity being rendered particularly uncertain owing to both the legacy effects of previous shocks and renewed risks. In addition, the current hiking cycle is unique, with the sequence of rate hikes being unprecedented in speed. Taking a longer-term view, structural changes in economic interactions may also exert upward pressure on inflation in a more fundamental way. At the global level, changes in trade patterns and energy markets, rising climate-related risks and the commitment to decarbonise the economy, as well as geopolitical risks, may have longer-lasting implications, which could pose greater challenges to price stability. For these reasons, any assessment based on comparisons with historical regularities and model-based estimates must be complemented by real-time monitoring of the transmission to financial and economic conditions. While there are signs of the strength of the first leg of the transmission, a substantial share of the transmission from financing conditions to the real economy is expected to still be in the pipeline, subject to longer lags. This reinforces the need for a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of a restrictive monetary policy stance.

The historian Gerald Feldman famously called those troubled years “the Great Disorder”.[1] And although the relative contributions of the hyperinflation of the 1920s and the deflation of the 1930s are still debated, there is little doubt that wild swings in prices eroded the economic foundations of democracy. One of the ways in which price instability does this is by triggering large distributional effects, which often hurt the poorest in society the most. For example, ECB analysis finds that the spike in inflation over the last 18 months has disproportionately affected low-income households as they spend more of their income on necessities like energy and food, which saw surging prices.[2] These are fundamental reasons why, in most liberal democracies, central banks have been entrusted with mandates to preserve price stability. And at the ECB, we will never compromise on our mandate. That is why, in response to rising inflation, we raised interest rates at the fastest pace in our history, by 450 basis points in just over a year. And we will return inflation to our medium-term target in a timely manner. However, having made such a large and fast adjustment, we are in a phase of our policy cycle which I would characterise as being “attentive and focused”. We need to be attentive to the different forces affecting inflation: the unwinding of past energy shocks, the strength of monetary policy transmission, the dynamics of wages and the evolution of inflation expectations. And we need to remain focused on bringing inflation back to our target, and not rush to premature conclusions based on short-term developments. The forces pushing down inflation There are two main forces pushing down inflation today. First, the energy and supply chain shocks which played a substantial role in last year’s inflation surge are now unwinding. At its peak, energy and food accounted for more than two-thirds of headline inflation in the euro area, despite representing less than one-third of the consumption basket. And together with supply chain disruptions, this also had a sizeable effect on core inflation – inflation excluding food and energy – as input costs rose for firms across the economy.[3] So, it is not surprising that as supply chains heal and energy prices fall, we are seeing the reverse effect, and both headline and core inflation are coming down. We expect headline inflation to rise again slightly in the coming months, mainly owing to some base effects. This reflects the sizeable drops in energy costs observed around the turn of last year, and the reversal of some of the fiscal measures that were put in place to fight the energy crisis. But we should see a further weakening of overall inflationary pressures. The second force is the impact of our monetary policy tightening. We had to tighten monetary policy forcefully to bring demand into line with supply and keep inflation expectations anchored while inflation surged. And this policy adjustment has fed quickly into financing conditions. But its peak impact on inflation will only materialise with a lag – and given the unprecedented scale and speed of our tightening, there is some uncertainty about how strong this effect will be. So, we need to be attentive to how these forces are working through the economy. But given the scale of our policy adjustment, we can now allow some time for them to unfold. That is why, at our last meeting, we held interest rates at their present levels. And based on our current assessment, we consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to returning inflation to our medium-term target in a timely manner. Avoiding persistent inflation But this is not the time to start declaring victory. The nature of the inflation process in the euro area means that we will need to remain attentive to the risks of persistent inflation as well. As wage-setting in the euro area is multi-annual and staggered, the high inflation rates that are now behind us are still having a significant influence on wage agreements today. For example, the annual growth rate[4] of compensation per employee was 5.6% in the second quarter of 2023, a 1.2 percentage point increase compared with the average for 2022. And the ability of workers to obtain higher wages is being supported by a tight labour market and strong demand for labour, which has proven surprisingly resilient to a slowing economy since the end of 2022. For now, our assessment is that strong wage growth mainly reflects “catch-up” effects related to past inflation, rather than a self-fulfilling dynamic where people expect higher inflation in the future. But to assess how wages are evolving and whether they pose a risk to price stability, we will be closely monitoring a number of developments. First, whether firms absorb rising wages in their profit margins[5], which would allow real wages to recover some of their past losses without the increase being fully passed through to inflation. Second, whether there is some easing of labour market tightness, which would prevent excess demand for labour from becoming a driver of persistently high wage demands. And third, that inflation expectations remain anchored, which ensures that, when the current shock passes, wage and price-setting will be guided by our 2% inflation target. In other words, we will need to remain attentive until we have firm evidence that the conditions are in place for inflation to return sustainably to our goal. That is why we have said our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. And we have made those future decisions conditional on the incoming data, meaning that we can act again if we see rising risks of missing our inflation target. Conclusion Let me conclude. We have faced a major inflation shock and we have made a major policy adjustment in response. The effects of that adjustment are increasingly being felt and inflation pressures are easing. But there is still a journey ahead of us. Our monetary policy is in a phase where we need to be attentive to the different forces affecting inflation – but always firmly focused on our mandate of price stability. Feldman, G.

The theme of the conference is “Monetary policy in an era of transformation”, and we have a rich programme ahead of us, exploring the changes that are taking place. But even if most of us can agree that the economy is undergoing substantial change, I imagine there are more diverging views about where it will end up. This lack of clarity presents a profound challenge for policymakers, as we must try at once to understand these transformations and to steer the economy through them. Indeed, much of the policy challenge over the last few years has involved stabilising inflation while facing fundamental uncertainty about the economy. Nevertheless, we have managed to chart a path through this uncertainty, and we have come a long way in the fight against inflation. In October 2022, inflation peaked at 10.6%. By September 2023, the last time we raised rates, it had fallen by more than half, to 5.2%. And then after nine months of holding rates steady, we saw inflation halve again to 2.6%, which led us to cut rates for the first time in June. Our work is not done, and we need to remain vigilant. But this progress allows us to look back and reflect on the path we have taken. This evening I would like to talk about three specific features that have defined this policy cycle: the risks, the path and the costs.[1] The risks Let me start with the risks. In a typical policy cycle, when fluctuations are driven by moderate and short-lived shocks, inflation expectations are usually not at risk. Central banks’ price stability mandates and reaction functions ensure confidence in the inflation target. When faced with typical demand shocks, central banks reach their target by stabilising demand around potential output. And when faced with supply shocks, central banks can in principle “look through” them, as these shocks will usually leave no lasting imprint on inflation. But this low risk to inflation expectations only applies when shocks are indeed moderate and short-lived. In situations where there is a risk of shocks becoming larger and more persistent, inflation expectations can de-anchor regardless of whether the shocks are demand-led or supply-led. Central banks must then react forcefully to prevent above-target inflation becoming entrenched. This was the lesson of the 1970s, when a sequence of supply shocks caused by rising oil prices ultimately morphed into a lasting inflationary shock. And with central banks at the time being seen as ambivalent about bringing down inflation, people revised their expectations about medium-term inflation. Different studies reach different conclusions about the origin of the current inflation episode. ECB analysis finds that, at the peak, supply shocks were three times more important than demand shocks in explaining the deviation of inflation from its mean.[2] Other research puts a greater emphasis on demand shocks.[3] But this delineation between supply and demand, while relevant, has not been the most important factor in our current cycle. We needed to base our decisions not only on the source of the shocks, but also on their size and persistence. This was because the shocks were so large and persistent that we faced a genuine risk to inflation expectations. Two features could have provided fertile ground for people to lose confidence in the monetary anchor. First, the shocks were large enough to make many households switch their attention to inflation. At the start of 2023, over 60% of respondents in our consumer expectations survey reported that they were paying more attention to inflation than in the past.[4] Second, the inflationary impact of the shocks risked becoming endogenously persistent, owing mainly to the staggered wage bargaining process in the euro area. Although there is large variation across countries, the average duration of wage contracts is two years, effectively guaranteeing a drawn-out process to “catch up” with past inflation.[5] We did see some signs that the anchoring of inflation expectations was becoming more vulnerable, especially via a fattening of the “right tail” of the distribution. In October 2022, around four in ten consumers expected medium-term inflation to be at or above 5% and professional forecasters assigned a 30% probability of inflation being at or above 3% two years later.[6] So, monetary policy had to send a strong signal that permanent overshoots of the inflation target would not be tolerated. As a result, we strongly emphasised our determination to ensure a “timely” return to target. Our aim was to convey our commitment to ensuring that the period of high inflation would be limited and signal a sense of urgency. The path But how does monetary policy anchor inflation expectations? It is not only about the policy destination, but also about setting the right trajectory of rates to get there. This brings me to the second specific feature of this cycle: the rate path. It was clear from the outset that merely communicating our commitment to reaching our target would not have been enough. ECB analysis shows that, if we had not reacted at all, the risk of de-anchoring would have been above 30% in 2023 and 2024.[7] It is likely that even moderate policy action would have been insufficient. For example, if rates had stopped at 2%, the risk of de-anchoring would still have been around 24%. So, when we first started raising rates, we knew that we were far from where we needed to be. The most important factor was therefore to close the gap as quickly as possible. This is why we had a historically steep climb at the start of our rate path, using increments of 75 and 50 basis points for our first six rate increases. But as policy rates moved towards restrictive territory, the challenge shifted from acting quickly to calibrating the path precisely. In particular, we needed to set a rate path that both delivered a “timely” return to 2% and did so with a high degree of confidence. This path also required us to take a different approach from the past. Faced with multiple large shocks, there was significant uncertainty about how to interpret and rank the information we were receiving from the economy. On the one hand, it would have been risky to rely too much on models trained on historical data, as those data may no longer have been valid. We could not know, for instance, whether shifts in preferences, higher energy prices and geopolitics had changed the structure of the economy. On the other hand, relying too much on current data might have been equally misleading if they had turned out to have little predictive power for the medium term. As shocks worked their way through the economy, current data could also have reflected lags more than actual inflation trends. So we constructed a framework to hedge against this uncertainty, blending projections with current data about underlying inflation and monetary transmission. The aim was to combine various pieces of information about the medium-term outlook into a single assessment that could be updated swiftly. Our forecasts provided a comprehensive assessment of future inflation, assuming the underlying parameters of the economy remained stable. At the same time, looking at current data allowed us to identify the persistent components of inflation and account for structural changes that might have been missing from our forecast models.[8] In this reaction function, our assessment of the inflation outlook is informed by, but not limited to, our projections. We use various measures to gauge underlying inflation. And when assessing the strength of monetary policy, we consider banks, capital markets and the real economy. As a result, while the flow of new information constantly adds to and improves our picture of medium-term inflation, we are not pushed around by any specific data point. Data dependence does not mean data point dependence. This framework helped us navigate the “tightening” and “holding” phases of our policy cycle, and it gave us the confidence to deliver a first rate cut at our last policy meeting. During these phases, we have seen the “right tail” of the distribution of inflation expectations narrow, consistent with a timely return of inflation to target. The costs But while our policy path has helped to tame inflation, it has also dampened economic growth. Interest rates rose steadily and remained high while the economy was stagnating for five straight quarters. This pattern is unavoidable when central banks face shocks that push inflation and output in opposing directions. But this time, the costs of disinflation have been contained compared with similar episodes in the past. This brings me to the third specific feature of this cycle. Given the magnitude of the shock to inflation, a “soft landing” is still not guaranteed. If we look at historical rate cycles since 1970, we can see that when major central banks hiked interest rates while energy prices were high, the costs for the economy were usually quite steep.[9] Only around 15% of the successful soft landings in this period – defined as avoiding either a recession or a major deterioration of employment – have been achieved following energy price shocks. But this cycle has so far not followed past patterns. Inflation peaked at a much higher point than during previous soft landings, but it also decelerated faster. Growth has remained within the range of previous soft landing episodes, albeit near the bottom of that range. And the performance of the labour market has been exceptionally benign. Employment has grown despite slowing GDP growth, rising by 2.6 million people since the end of 2022. And unemployment is at historical lows for the euro area, and well within the range observed during previous soft landings across major economies. The resilience of the labour market is itself a reflection of the unusual mix of shocks that have hit the euro area, with labour shortages leading firms to hoard more labour, and higher profits and lower real wages making it easier for them to do so.[10] As a result, the usual propagation from slower growth to heightened unemployment risks and lower demand did not happen to the same extent. Now, we are still facing several uncertainties regarding future inflation, especially in terms of how the nexus of profits, wages and productivity will evolve and whether the economy will be hit by new supply-side shocks. And it will take time for us to gather sufficient data to be certain that the risks of above-target inflation have passed. The strong labour market means that we can take time to gather new information, but we also need to be mindful of the fact that the growth outlook remains uncertain. All of this underpins our determination to be data dependent and to take our policy decisions meeting by meeting. Conclusion Let me conclude. Our policy decisions have successfully kept inflation expectations anchored, and inflation is projected to return to 2% in the latter part of next year. Considering the size of the inflation shock, this unwinding is remarkable in many ways. Even though millions of businesses and workers have been independently striving to protect their profits and incomes, our 2% inflation target has remained credible and has continued to anchor the inflation process. This speaks to the value of the policy frameworks that central banks have built up over the last 30 years, focusing on price stability and central bank independence. And it is why we will not waver from our commitment to bring inflation back down to our target for the benefit of all Europeans. As the late footballer and manager Sir Bobby Robson said, “the first 90 minutes are the most important”. Similarly, we will not rest until the match is won and inflation is back at 2%.

Lane,,all_ECB_speeches.csv,"SPEECH The monetary policy strategy of the ECB: the playbook for monetary policy decisions Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Hertie School, Berlin Berlin, 2 March 2022 I welcome the invitation to speak at the Hertie School, which has such a strong record in European public policy research, including research on the institutional architecture of the euro area. I especially wish to acknowledge the exceptional contributions of the late Professor Henrik Enderlein, who played a founding role in the development of the Jacques Delors Centre. Before turning to the topic of today’s lecture, I wish to comment on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. At stated by President Lagarde last Friday, at this dark moment for Europe, the thoughts of the ECB’s Governing Council are with the people of Ukraine. The ECB is closely monitoring the evolving situation. With regard to policy measures, the ECB will implement the sanctions decided by the EU and the European governments. The ECB will also ensure smooth liquidity conditions and the access of citizens to cash. The ECB stands ready to take whatever action is needed to fulfil its responsibilities to ensure price stability and financial stability in the euro area. Today, I wish to frame the current monetary policy debate in the context of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB.[1] I will not dwell on the latest conjunctural developments or speculate on the evolution of the medium-term outlook for the economy and inflation. Our monetary policy meeting next week will provide the best opportunity for a comprehensive assessment of economic and financial developments and the implications for near-term and medium-term inflation dynamics. In this respect, the schedule for the March staff projections exercise has been revised in order to take into account the implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The revised schedule also means that today’s Eurostat inflation release will be incorporated in the projections that will be considered at next week’s monetary policy meeting. Chart 1 provides some empirical context for the discussion by showing the evolution of headline and core inflation since 2014. It underlines that, until quite recently, the euro area has been confronted with a low-inflation problem, with inflation persistently well below two per cent. At the same time, Chart 1 also shows the sharp increase in inflation in recent months. The flash inflation estimate for February that was published today stands at 5.8 per cent. The upward pressure on overall inflation from the extraordinary 31.7 per cent rate of energy inflation is operating through both direct and indirect channels, since the increases in the sectoral inflation rates for food, goods and services in part reflect the impact of higher energy prices for production costs in all sectors of the economy. In recent weeks, I have emphasised that much of the sharp increase in the last six months can be attributed to the large-scale shock to energy prices and pandemic-related factors (including supply bottlenecks).[2] In any event, it is essential for a central bank to ensure that its monetary policy stance fully takes into account the implications of the shift in the inflation environment. Chart 1 Headline and core inflation in the euro area (annual percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat and ECB. Note: The latest observations are for February 2022 (flash release). Chart 2 shows the dynamics since 1999 of the estimated equilibrium nominal interest rate, which is constructed as the sum of the two per cent inflation target and the equilibrium real interest rate, which is the real interest rate that is consistent with full utilisation of available resources and inflation steady at the target. The trend decline in equilibrium interest rates was a first-order issue in the strategy review exercise. In particular, a low equilibrium interest rate means that any robust monetary policy strategy must take into account the effective lower bound on policy rates.

A monetary policy strategy serves two main purposes: first, it provides policymakers with a coherent analytical framework that maps actual or expected economic developments into policy decisions; and, second, it serves as a tool for communicating with the public. A strategic approach to monetary policy is especially valuable when confronted with possible shifts in the underlying forces shaping inflation dynamics. Rather than policymakers having to search in the dark for the appropriate policy response, a robust monetary policy strategy provides policymakers with the playbook for handling a wide range of scenarios. The extensive Eurosystem monetary policy strategy review exercise during 2020 and 2021 considered a vast array of factors relevant for the conduct of monetary policy: the work of the Eurosystem staff was organised into thirteen workstreams and their many individual background notes are synthesised in the 18 Occasional Papers released in autumn 2021. Of course, the strategy review did not start from scratch: there was much to retain from the earlier phases in the development of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, both in terms of the initial design in 1998 and the review in 2003. Rather than trying to provide a comprehensive overview of all of the dimensions of the entire strategy review, I will focus today on the guidance it provides for the conduct of monetary policy in pursuit of the two per cent inflation target over the medium term. The new strategy takes a symmetric perspective on deviations from the two per cent target: overshoots and undershoots are equally undesirable. The focal point provided by the two per cent target makes for clearer communication. This is in line with a fundamental conclusion of the strategy review, which identified a simpler communication style as highly desirable. In addition to providing a stronger anchor for inflation expectations, a strategic commitment to simplifying the communication of monetary policy also makes it easier for the ECB to be held accountable and for it to build trust among the general public. Regarding the symmetry of the inflation target, the recognition that deviations from the target in either direction are equally undesirable implies that a risk-management approach to the calibration of monetary policy should balance equally the risks of inflation being too high and too low. At the same time, the symmetry of the target does not necessarily imply symmetry in policy responses to these risks, in view of the constraints imposed by the effective lower bound in reacting to below-target inflation. As to the policy instruments that can be deployed, the set of policy interest rates takes primacy and should be sufficient to deliver the two per cent target in scenarios in which the economy is not operating in the shadow of the effective lower bound and in which financial conditions are non-stressed. However, when the economy is close to the lower bound (either as a result of a sequence of adverse shocks or simply due to a sufficiently-low equilibrium real interest rate such that even the steady-state nominal interest rate is close to the lower bound), the strategy review concluded that monetary policy measures should be especially forceful or persistent to avoid negative deviations from the inflation target becoming entrenched. Moreover, adopting forceful or persistent measures may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target, since a persistently-accommodative stance that successfully lifts inflation towards the target may involve hump-shaped adjustment dynamics for the inflation path. In particular, maintaining some policy measures on a persistent basis acknowledges that a commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodation into the future can partially substitute for sharper near-term policy easing measures. The forward guidance provided by the ECB on asset purchases and interest rates reflects the instrument hierarchy outlined in the strategy review. In relation to net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), the forward guidance is that these will be maintained for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of policy rates and that these are expected to end shortly before the key ECB interest rates are raised. This forward guidance clearly expresses that net asset purchases are designed to supplement the primary role of the set of policy rates (in recognition of the limitations associated with the effective lower bound) but that net asset purchases would cease if the inflation environment no longer required the accommodative impact of policy rates to be reinforced. Moreover, this also implies a clear sequencing: the end date for net asset purchases is naturally earlier than the date at which it would be appropriate to raise the key policy rates. Introduced in September 2019, the guidance that net asset purchases are expected to end only shortly before the key ECB interest rates are raised provides the reassurance that net asset purchases would not be prematurely terminated. In relation to interest rate forward guidance, three key conditions should be met before interest rates are raised: The first condition “until we see inflation reaching two per cent well ahead of the end of our projection horizon” provides reassurance that the convergence of inflation towards the new target should be sufficiently advanced and mature at the time of policy rate lift off. Moreover, requiring the inflation target to be reached “well ahead of the end of the projection horizon” helps to hedge monetary policy against the risk of relying excessively on inflation projections at the long-end of the projection horizon, where forecast errors tend to be larger under typical conditions.[3] The second condition -- that we expect inflation to reach two per cent not only well ahead of the end of the projection horizon but also “durably for the rest of the projection horizon” -- telegraphs that inflation reaching the target should be lasting and not just be the result of short-lived forces that lead to one-time increases in prices that are unlikely to lead to persistently higher year-over-year inflation. The third condition, which requires “progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at two per cent over the medium term”, signals that policy rates should not be lifted unless underlying inflation is also judged to have made satisfactory progress towards the target. This condition is based on realised data and provides an extra safeguard against a policy tightening in the face of cost-push shocks that might elevate headline inflation temporarily but fade within the projection horizon. It is important to recognise that underlying inflation is a broad concept and refers to the persistent component of inflation that filters out short-lived movements in the inflation rate and that provides the best guide to medium-term inflation developments. In the current context, two factors make it especially difficult to interpret standard indicators of underlying inflation. First, the scale of the energy shock means that the producers of many goods and services that are included in the core inflation measure face higher energy input costs and are passing these cost increases on to consumer prices. To the extent that the increase in energy prices is a level effect, it follows that the knock-on impact on core prices is also primarily a level effect, rather than necessarily representing a shift in the persistent component of inflation. Second, the bottlenecks generated by the sectoral shifts in demand and supply associated with the pandemic are currently generating temporary inflation pressures, which also do not necessarily constitute a source of persistent inflation pressure. Policymakers must strike the right balance in responding to shifts in projected inflation. In one direction, if forecasts indicate that the inflation target will be reached within the projection horizon, waiting for realised inflation to converge to the target before tightening might be excessively costly, especially if inflation expectations become de-anchored to the upside. Under this scenario, excessive delay in monetary tightening runs the risk of a sharper subsequent hike in interest rates and a greater loss in output. In the other direction, if current inflation is above the target level but the forecasts indicate that inflation will fall below the target level over the projection horizon, tightening policy in response to temporarily-high inflation would be counterproductive. Under this scenario, premature monetary tightening runs the risk of an economic slowdown and a reversal in the medium-term inflation dynamic, de-railing the prospects of ultimate convergence to the inflation target. Of course, assessing these different types of policy errors is especially difficult in the current context of high uncertainty, the unique circumstances of the pandemic and policy settings that have long been driven by the twin challenges of excessively-low medium-term inflation pressures and the constraints associated with the effective lower bound. An important element in the strategy review was to re-confirm the medium-term orientation of the ECB’s monetary policy. In line with the Treaty mandate and without prejudice to price stability, the medium-term orientation allows for inevitable short-term deviations of inflation from the target, as well as lags and uncertainty in the transmission of monetary policy to the economy and to inflation. It also provides room for monetary policy to take into account considerations such as balanced economic growth, full employment and financial stability. Under many scenarios, these are mutually consistent objectives. In particular, so long as longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the target level, inflation will be at the target level if economic activity and employment are at their potential levels. However, in the event of an adverse supply shock, the horizon over which inflation returns to the target level could be lengthened in order to avoid pronounced falls in economic activity and employment, which, if persistent, could jeopardise medium-term price stability. This consideration is relevant in developing the appropriate monetary policy response to the current energy shock and pandemic shock. In particular, it should be recognised that the prevalence of downward nominal rigidities in wages and prices means that surprises in relative price movements should mainly be accommodated by tolerating a temporary increase in the inflation rate, rather than by seeking to maintain a constant inflation rate that could only be achieved by a substantial reduction in overall demand and activity levels. At the same time, it is essential to avoid that a spell of temporarily-high inflation pressures – even if arising from a supply shock – becomes entrenched by permanently altering longer-term inflation expectations. Accordingly, central banks must closely monitor the evolution of indicators of longer-term inflation expectations. From a policy perspective, the clearer is the commitment to the medium-term target of two per cent, the less likely is the de-anchoring of inflation expectations, since everyone should recognise that the central bank will take decisive action to ensure that deviations from the inflation target do not last too long and do not put at risk the stabilisation of inflation at two per cent over the medium term. The new monetary policy strategy also contains a general commitment to base monetary policy decisions, including the evaluation of the proportionality of its decisions and potential side effects, on an integrated assessment of all relevant factors. Compared to the previous two-pillar analytical approach, there is an emphasis under the new integrated framework on taking into account the inherent macrofinancial links between the real economy, the monetary system and the financial system in terms of the underlying structures, shocks and adjustment processes. This framework reflects the importance of monitoring the transmission mechanism in calibrating monetary policy instruments and the recognition that financial stability is a precondition for price stability. An important type of macro-financial risk in the euro area is that, under stressed conditions, self-fulfilling cross-border flight-to-safety episodes can impair the monetary policy transmission mechanism and threaten price stability. This is an inherent risk in a multi-country monetary union, since geographical portfolio shifts are facilitated by the absence of currency risk (compounded by the incomplete nature of the EMU architecture in relation to fiscal union and banking union) and can be reinforced by the lack of country-specific monetary policy instruments. Although monetary policy can be implemented in a uniform way most of the time, the ECB has demonstrated its capacity to design flexible instruments in reaction to stressed conditions through policy responses such as the Securities Market Programme (SMP), the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme and the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). In recognition of the strategic importance of protecting the monetary policy transmission mechanism, the December 2021 monetary policy statement affirmed: “Within our mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability.” In addition to this general recognition of the value of flexibility under stressed conditions, the monetary policy statement also noted that, even after the end of net purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022, the accumulated PEPP portfolio can play a stabilising role: “In particular, in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time.” Conclusion The 2021 strategy review lays the foundations for monetary policy decisions in the coming years. There is a clear anchor for monetary policy: we will set monetary policy to ensure that inflation stabilises at two per cent over the medium term. The medium-term orientation allows for inevitable short-term deviations of inflation from the target, as well as lags and uncertainty in the transmission of monetary policy to the economy and to inflation. The flexibility of the medium-term orientation takes into account that the appropriate monetary policy response to a deviation of inflation from the target is context-specific and depends on the origin, magnitude and persistence of the deviation. In terms of policy instruments, there is a clear hierarchy. If the economy is not in the shadow of the effective lower bound and under non-stressed conditions, the set of policy interest rates is sufficient to deliver the inflation target. In particular, away from the effective lower bound, policy rates can be adjusted in either direction in response to upside or downside risks to the inflation target. However, in recognition of the effective lower bound on policy rates, the Governing Council can also employ forward guidance, asset purchases and longer-term refinancing operations, as appropriate. The Governing Council will continue to respond flexibly to new challenges as these arise and consider, as needed, new policy instruments in the pursuit of its price stability objective.

Ludwig Erhard once described it as the emblem of German ambition and vitality. And, over the years, Hanover has been justifiably proud of its role in Germany’s industrial development. Nowhere is this more obvious than at the Hannover Messe. Since inception in 1947, Hannover Messe has showcased the passion and economic potential of German workers and entrepreneurs to the world. The fair has become a symbol of the German Wirtschaftswunder, intimately linked to post-war German reconstruction and the subsequent economic and industrial success. Success in which the German savings banks have played a pivotal role. With a history spanning 200 years, you have consistently served as a reliable financial partner, supporting and promoting the German industry through crises and transformation. It is no wonder that around three out of four businesses in Germany are customers of the savings banks.[1] And your business is also the intersection point of our monetary policy and the economy. We depend on banks to transmit our policy to firms and households – in good times and in bad. Our changes to interest rates feed through into bank lending rates, altering people’s propensity to spend and invest – and ultimately the path of growth, employment and inflation. In this sense, even though we have different goals, we are partners in the pursuit of price stability. Today, inflation is too high and it is set to remain so for too long. We are determined to bring it back down to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. That is why we have hiked rates at our fastest pace ever – and we have made clear that we still have ground to cover to bring interest rates to sufficiently restrictive levels. These hikes are already feeding forcefully into bank lending conditions, including here in Germany. And we know that – having hiked so far and so fast – considerable tightening is still in the pipeline. But it remains uncertain just how much stronger the transmission of our policy will be. So, we need to continue our hiking cycle until we are sufficiently confident that inflation is on track to return to our target in a timely manner. At the same time, we need to carefully assess the strength of monetary policy transmission to financing conditions, the economy and inflation. In my remarks today, I would like to look at what we have done so far to fight inflation and explain the factors that will determine our future decisions towards bringing inflation down. The distance covered so far Since the outset of the pandemic, the euro area has been hit by a series of sudden, overlapping and self-reinforcing shocks which, together, have sent inflation soaring. Shocks to the supply side – notably the supply bottlenecks created by the pandemic, the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis – have raised input costs for firms. And this has been felt particularly hard here in Germany, where businesses have seen delivery times reach historic highs, critical materials are in short supply and producer prices for energy – despite recent falls – are still much higher than they were in January 2021.[2] That was an important reason why the economy fell into recession over the winter. At the same time, shocks to demand, especially the surge in spending as the economy reopened, have allowed firms to pass on these costs to prices much faster and more strongly than in the past. In combination, these shocks led to headline inflation in the euro area exceeding 10% at one point last year. The ECB entered this period with a highly accommodative policy that had been geared to fighting a decade of too-low inflation and the deflationary risks created by lockdowns. But once we had clear evidence that the inflation outlook was shifting, we changed tack completely – and rapidly. Already in December 2021, we announced that we would discontinue net asset purchases under the bond buying programme we had introduced during the pandemic, and would gradually reduce net asset purchases under the previous asset purchase programme.[3] Then, as inflation accelerated in early 2022, we announced that we would conclude net purchases under all our purchase programmes even sooner. As a result, even before we began raising policy rates, longer-maturity market rates had moved up by almost 200 basis points.[4] The battle had begun. We started rate hikes in July 2022 and, since then, we have raised rates by 375 basis points in less than a year – from -0.5% to 3.25% today. So, we have moved in a deliberate and decisive way to fight inflation. And though inflation is still too high, this rapid policy adjustment has put us in a different position today. Think of an airplane climbing to cruising altitude. At the start, the plane needs to ascend steeply and accelerate fast. But as it gets closer to its target altitude, it can reduce acceleration and retain its existing airspeed. The plane needs to climb high enough to reach its destination – but not so high as to exceed it. Similarly, when we began hiking rates out of negative territory, in all scenarios there was a steep ascent ahead and so it made sense for us to move rapidly. Now, we are approaching our cruising altitude – and that means we need to climb more gradually, using the speed that we have already built up behind us. This analogy helps explain why, at our last meeting in May, we raised interest rates again – making clear that we were not there yet. But we also reduced the pace of rate hikes to a more standard increment of 25 basis points. How much higher do we need to go? That will depend on our assessment of the incoming data. And to help the public understand what sources of information will matter to us for these decisions, we have clarified our reaction function. Three factors will be decisive: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Let me explain how we currently assess each one. The inflation outlook First, given that interest rate changes affect the economy with long lags[5], we look at the inflation outlook. Our best tool for doing so is the ECB's staff projections, which offer a comprehensive picture of the inflation path over the medium term, taking into account all relevant economic and financial information. To be sure that we have set the right monetary policy, we want to see inflation returning to 2% in our projections in a timely manner. This timeliness is important because the longer inflation remains above our target, the greater the risk that it infiltrates people’s expectations. In March, we projected annual average headline inflation to be 2.1% in 2025 – still slightly above our target. And we did not see year-on-year inflation rates returning to 2% until the second half of 2025. At our last meeting in May, we judged that the incoming data broadly supported those projections. On the basis of these past projections we cannot yet say that we are satisfied with the inflation outlook. But we will have a new set of projections at our meeting on 15 June, and these will give us an updated picture incorporating the additional policy tightening since then. In any case, in the uncertain and volatile environment we face today, it would not be wise to condition our policies solely on medium-term projections, which are surrounded by too much uncertainty. That is why our reaction function has a second element – the dynamics of underlying inflation. Underlying inflation Underlying inflation refers to the slow-moving part of inflation which, when temporary shocks have faded, will persist into the medium term. Therefore, by looking at underlying inflation, we can be more confident that inflation is on the right path. And it has an important benefit – measures of underlying inflation can be observed in real time. However, there is no clear evidence that underlying inflation has peaked. To date, all measures monitored by the ECB are still strong. And whether they remain so will depend mainly on the balance between two forces: energy prices and wages. On the one hand, as energy is an important input into every economic activity, the sharp rise in energy prices last year has fed through to all prices – including those that make up our various measures of underlying inflation. But energy prices have dropped considerably since then, which should have the opposite effect. HICP energy inflation in Germany fell from 44.2% in September 2022 to 9.4% in April 2023. This decline in energy costs for both consumers and producers should, in turn, limit firms’ ability to further raise profit margins, which has been a key factor driving recent price pressures in the euro area.[6] Consumers are less likely to accept disproportionate price rises when they know that firms are saving on their energy bills. On the other hand, mounting wage pressures are becoming a more important driver of inflation. So far, workers have faced a significant loss from the erosion in overall labour income caused by the energy crisis. In the euro area, real wages at the end of last year were still around 4 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels. But labour markets across the euro area are tight and workers have considerable bargaining power, which they are starting to use to recoup these losses. This is especially visible here in Germany, where labour shortages reached historic highs in the second half of last year,[7] leading to strong wage agreements in many sectors. Wage growth in Germany increased from 3.9% in the fourth quarter of last year to 5.1% in the first quarter of this year.[8] To be clear: a period of catch-up wage growth need not cause unduly persistent inflation over time – if the costs of the energy shock are ultimately shared in a balanced way between firms and workers. But if we start to see what I have called “tit-for-tat” inflation[9] – with both parties trying to offset any real income losses[10] – we could see a negative spiral taking hold. Monetary policy transmission The ECB cannot allow this to happen. And since profits are ultimately influenced by the business cycle, it is our responsibility to restrict demand enough to prevent such a spiral. That should, in turn, lead to slower margin growth and lower wage demands while reducing pressure in the labour market. But to gauge whether rates are sufficiently restrictive, we need to know how much traction our policy tightening is having – and is likely to have – on spending in the economy. That is why policy transmission is the third element we are looking at. So far, our rate hikes are being transmitted forcefully to bank borrowing[11] and lending rates – faster even than during previous hiking cycles. For the euro area, bank lending rates to firms currently stand at 4.2%, up by 267 basis points since May last year. This is their highest level since January 2009. Bank lending volumes are also weakening, leading to a sharp contraction in money growth. From November onwards, monthly lending flows to firms have been negative on average. Money (M3) has also seen negative flows, causing its year-on-year growth rate to plunge from almost 12% in mid-2020 to 1.9% in April this year. And banks report that credit standards are tightening, which heralds lower lending flows to come. In the ECB’s latest bank lending survey, the pace of net tightening in credit standards was at its highest level since the sovereign debt crisis in 2011.[12] This is the desired effect of our policy: we want financing conditions to tighten. And, so far, it has not been at the expense of bank performance, with the positive impact of higher rates on banks' interest margins outweighing the negative impact on volumes.[13] But we know that our rate hikes have not yet been fully reflected in financing conditions. And we are also aware that recent financial market tensions may have intensified the tightening by increasing bank funding costs and encouraging more risk aversion. So we need to monitor carefully how this pass-through process is playing out. And if the recent tensions do leave a lasting footprint on markets, a given level of rates would mean tighter financing conditions – and that would have to be reflected in the level at which rates peak. At the same time, there is also uncertainty about how tighter financing conditions will affect the economy, and whether the effects will be stronger or weaker than in the past. Firms have not faced a steep rise in funding costs for more than a decade, while the economy has changed considerably in that time – and may still be changing after the pandemic. This means that we need to observe closely the impact of our measures over time. We might already be seeing some early indications of their effects across sectors. A marked divergence has emerged between manufacturing activity, which looks to be contracting, and services, which are expanding – especially in the leisure and tourism sectors. This can largely be explained by continued reopening effects: people are consuming more of the services they were denied during the pandemic, such as travel and eating out, while spending less on goods that they stocked up on during lockdowns. But monetary policy may also be playing a role. Tighter financing conditions may already be constraining households’ total spending, forcing them to substitute between sectors. And spending on durable goods is likely to be more affected by higher financing costs, as some of these are typically bought on credit. By contrast, for this summer at least, our consumer surveys show that tighter monetary policy is not going to affect people’s holiday plans.[14] As our rate increases percolate through the economy, we will get a clearer picture of how much the tightening we have already done is biting – and how much more is needed to ensure that inflation is decisively squeezed out of the economy. Conclusion Let me conclude. The motto of the Sparkassen is “Weil’s um mehr als Geld geht”. And this, in many ways, also applies to the ECB. Our job is to create money and to preserve its value. But we do so because, in the long run, price stability produces the best and fairest outcomes for people and businesses. Today, to return to my analogy, the airplane is still climbing – and it will keep going until we have enough speed to glide sustainably and land at our destination. But the reaction function we have laid out will help to strike the right balance for our monetary policy decisions in the future: between further tightening to tame inflation on the one hand and uncertainty about the speed and strength of policy transmission on the other. One thing, however, is certain: we will keep moving forward – determined and undeterred – until we see inflation returning to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner.

ECB staff model-based analysis suggests that, on average, the peak impact of a policy rate hike on economic growth is reached during the second year after its implementation, and the peak impact on inflation typically takes even longer (ranging between three and four years, depending on the estimation method). In the fourth quarter of last year, unit profits in the euro area contributed slightly more than half to domestic price pressures as measured by the GDP deflator, compared with a historical average of one-third.

Lane,,all_ECB_speeches.csv,"SPEECH The 2021-2022 inflation surges and the monetary policy response through the lens of macroeconomic models Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the SUERF Marjolin Lecture hosted by the Banca d’Italia Rome, 18 November 2024 Introduction My aim today is to explain how macroeconomic models can help in understanding the extraordinary 2021-2022 inflation surges and the monetary policy response, in the context of the euro area.[1] By and large, the scale and persistence of the inflation surge surprised the central banking community, external experts and market participants. The unexpected nature of the inflation surge triggered many questions about the performance of macroeconomic forecasters. At the same time, macroeconomic models can help us understand why the baseline projections did not foresee the inflation surge in its full scale and speed, while shedding light on the possible mechanisms and channels that may have been missed or under-stated. Scenario analysis has been enhanced and new models have been developed to enrich our understanding of the shocks that hit the economy over this period, as well as the mechanisms through which these shocks were transmitted to inflation. Models also play a central role in constructing some of the measures of underlying inflation that the Governing Council uses as an important cross-check for the inflation outlook. And models are essential in constructing policy counterfactuals to assess whether alternative monetary policy responses might have substantially reduced the scale of the inflation surge. Models therefore play an important role in strengthening our understanding of the recent inflationary surge and assessing the monetary policy response. Model-based retrospective analysis provides several insights into the 2021-2022 inflation surges. The large forecast errors in the inflation outlook over this period were driven, at least initially, by energy and commodity price shocks, especially following the Russia-Ukraine war, and pandemic-related bottlenecks. Subsequently, changes in the transmission of shocks through the pricing chain, and in the behaviour of firms and consumers, likely played an important role in amplifying and propagating these shocks across the economy, converting relative price shocks into a general inflation shock. Supply shocks, primarily originating from external sources, were key drivers of the inflation surges. While global and domestic surges in sectoral demand patterns also contributed to sectoral demand-supply mismatches (in the goods sector in 2020-2021 during the most intense phases of global pandemic lockdowns; in the services sector in 2022 during the post-pandemic reopening phase), the overall level of aggregate demand in the euro area was only barely above pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022. The pre-dominant role of supply shocks, combined with the fact that inflation expectations were initially signalling significant downside risks, supported the initial looking-through approach for monetary policy. In this context, it is also essential to recall the sequential nature of the shocks: the focus in 2021 was on pandemic-related supply disruptions and sectoral demand-supply mismatches, while the unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 subsequently triggered extraordinary jumps in gas and oil prices.[2] The post-pandemic full-scale reopening of contact-intensive services sectors also took place in early 2022, after the ending of Omicron-related lockdowns. Put together, the second and third quarters of 2022 saw an extraordinary cocktail of inflation shocks, between the war-related commodity and supply chain shocks and the demand-supply mismatches in the reopening contact-intensive service sectors. If policymakers had had perfect foresight about the shocks that were about to hit the economy, interest rates would have been raised earlier and more sharply. However, conditional on the real-time information available to policymakers (including how this information shaped baseline macroeconomic projections), monetary policy decisions in 2021-2022 were broadly in line with the policy paths indicated by the macroeconomic models.[3] This assessment includes both the initial phase in which monetary policy did not respond to the early stages of the rise in inflation and the subsequent phase of a sharp and sustained tightening cycle. This monetary policy response was, and continues to be, an important contributor to the disinflation process. Macroeconomic models have played a central role in helping policymakers in charting this monetary policy course, through their roles in: (a) macroeconomic forecasting; (b) estimating underlying inflation; and (c) calibrating the appropriate interest rate path. This assessment puts the spotlight on the quality of the information set available to policymakers, especially in relation to the macroeconomic projections. I will cover this topic in the next section. The 2021-2022 inflation surges: what did models miss? The inflation surges in 2021 and 2022 surprised professional forecasters, both at the ECB and across other institutions and countries.[4] Inflation turned out to be much higher and more persistent than had been projected. This is clear from the very large and persistent forecast errors at both short and medium-term horizons in the Eurosystem and ECB staff projections for headline and core inflation. For example, forecast errors at the one-quarter ahead horizon during this period were more than five times larger than the average errors over the previous twenty years for headline inflation (and around twice as large for core inflation) and had the same direction for several successive quarters (Chart 1, left and middle panels). Indeed, the projection error in the December 2021 Broad Macroeconomic Projection Exercise (BMPE) for the year-over-year inflation rate at the end of 2022 was the largest ever, at around eight percentage points. Projection errors were also materially larger than historical averages at medium-term horizons, with projections made early in the period suggesting that inflation would either return to target or fall below target well within the projection horizon. The errors in inflation at a four-quarter horizon, for example, were more than nine times larger during 2022 than the historic pre-pandemic average. This is important, since the medium-term inflation outlook is typically the most relevant for policymakers, given significant lags in the transmission of policy rate changes to inflation. The projection errors for GDP growth were smaller than for inflation, but still significantly above their historical range (Chart 1, right panel). Chart 1 One-quarter-ahead errors in the inflation projections of Eurosystem/ECB staff Sources: Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area and Eurostat. Notes: An error is defined as the outturn for a given quarter minus the projection made for that quarter in the previous quarter (for example, the outturn for the fourth quarter of 2022 minus the figure projected for that quarter in the September 2022 ECB staff macroeconomic projections). The latest observation is from the September 2024 ECB staff Macroeconomic Projection Exercise (MPE). In understanding these large forecast errors over 2021-2022, it is important to differentiate between errors due to conditioning assumptions – especially linked to shocks to key variables such as energy or food prices – and errors in the way these assumptions were propagated through the forecasting models. The starting point for the ECB staff projections is a set of conditioning assumptions for the future evolution of key input variables, known as “technical assumptions”.[5] For example, the paths for inputs such as commodity prices, including oil and gas prices, and short-term interest rates are based on market expectations at the time of the projection cut-off date.[6] The right panel of Chart 2 shows that the expected paths for oil and gas prices were revised up repeatedly over successive projection rounds at the end of 2021 and throughout 2022. This highlights how energy prices were repeatedly expected by markets – and therefore by our projection models – to decline. However, a sequence of upward surprises to energy prices materialised, especially following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This sequence of shocks pushed up inflation and compounded forecast errors over successive projection rounds. Chart 2 Headline inflation and energy composite projections from Q1 2020 to Q3 2024 Sources: Eurosystem/ECB staff projections and Eurostat for left-hand scale. Refinitiv and ECB staff calculations for right-hand scale. Notes: Projections for the synthetic energy price index were introduced in 2021. Its methodology was changed in 2023. To account for this, projections before 2023 have been rebased to the new Synthetic Energy Commodity Price Index (SECPI) index. The latest observation is from the September 2024 MPE for the left-hand scale and for the third quarter of 2024 for the right-hand scale. In order to quantify the importance of energy price and other shocks in driving inflation projection errors, we can use models to construct counterfactual paths for inflation under a scenario in which forecasters had perfect foresight at each projection round about how energy prices and other conditioning variables would actually evolve over the projection horizon. This allows projection errors from incorrect technical assumptions to be isolated from the errors related to the transmission of shocks as embedded in models. Of course, the results from such a decomposition depend on the specific model. It is also important to keep in mind that the ECB/Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections are not purely model based but also include staff judgement.[7] One way to carry out this counterfactual exercise is to use the Basic Model Elasticities (BMEs) of the Eurosystem national central banks (NCBs), which summarise the key relations between projection variables.[8] This exercise suggests that a substantial share of forecast errors for inflation during 2021 and 2022 was due to errors in the technical assumptions.[9] For example, errors in assumptions about oil and gas prices accounted for the majority of the one-quarter ahead inflation projection error until early 2022 (yellow and green bars in Chart 3).[10] Subsequently, however, the importance of other factors affecting food and core inflation grew in importance. Chart 3 Decomposition of recent one-quarter-ahead HICP inflation errors in Eurosystem/ECB staff projections (annual percentage points; percentage point contributions) Source: ECB calculations. Notes: “Total error” is the outturn minus the projection. The labels on the horizontal axis indicate the quarter in which the projections were published and the quarter to which those projections relate (i.e. “Q4 20 for Q1 21” denotes projections for the first quarter of 2021 that were published in the fourth quarter of 2020). The decomposition is based on updated elasticities derived from Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projection models as at late 2023. “Other assumptions” refers to exchange rates, short and long-term interest rates, stock prices, foreign demand, competitors’ export prices and food prices”. The latest observation is from the June 2024 Eurosystem staff Broad Macroeconomic Projection Exercise (BMPE). Further insight can be gained by running this counterfactual exercise in a fully-fledged macroeconomic model. ECB-BASE is the workhorse large-scale estimated semi-structural model used at the ECB to support and cross-check the staff projection exercises.[11] Decomposing the eight percentage point projection error at the peak of inflation in the fourth quarter of 2022 – relative to what had been projected in December 2021 – confirms that around half was due to unexpected developments in technical assumptions around oil and gas prices (red and yellow bars in Chart 4). Nearly one third, on the other hand, was due to errors in food inflation (dark grey bar in Chart 4), while the remainder was due to other factors that drove the error in core inflation (light grey bars in Chart 4). As such, errors in the set of technical assumptions go a long way towards explaining the forecast errors.[12] At the same time, a sizeable share of the inflation forecast errors over this period cannot be explained by errors in the assumptions around energy and food prices. Two explanations for the remaining errors seem plausible. The first explanation relates to statistical uncertainty. Macroeconomic forecasting models are underpinned by empirical estimates of model relations that are based on historical regularities. Statistical uncertainty around these estimates maps into statistical uncertainty around the central tendency of the inflation projection. Conditioning on the ex-post values for the technical assumptions, the statistical distribution around the inflation projections from the vantage point of December 2021 is relatively wide (Chart 4, blue area).[13] The actual inflation outturns (solid blue line in Chart 4) experienced during the inflation surge were close to the bounds of this model uncertainty, although inflation was still slightly too high to be compatible with the model in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023. Overall, correcting for the actual path of energy prices and other conditioning variables, it cannot be ruled out that actual inflation was largely consistent with the historically-estimated statistical distribution around forecasts. This would imply that the economic relations estimated in the models to capture the transmission of shocks to inflation have remained broadly valid during the inflation surge, so long as the full statistical distribution is taken into account.

Note: “December 2021 BMPE + assumptions” is simulated using the December BMPE baseline, but imposing the paths of HICP energy, HICP food and other technical assumptions from the June 2024 BMPE. The second explanation is that economic relations might also have (temporarily) shifted during this extraordinary episode, including through an array of non-linear responses to the scale and combination of the shocks and the shift in the level of inflation. For example, in a high inflation environment, firms may adjust their prices more often than normal, in an attempt to pass on rapidly rising input and operational costs and protect their profits.[14] Furthermore, the broadening of the inflation shock from the energy sector (including via the food sector) to the services sector may also have been amplified during 2022 by the strong demand for contact-intensive services (tourism, hospitality) due to the reopening of these sectors after the final pandemic lockdowns. While costs were increasing quickly, the price elasticity of demand for services was plausibly atypically low due to this pandemic reopening phase, allowing for a greater pass-through of the cost shocks. Furthermore, these conditions were ripe for a non-linear responses feedback loop between inflation and short-term inflation expectations. It is plausible that short-term inflation expectations are more sensitive to large inflation shocks than to small inflation shocks. Although longer-term inflation expectations remained broadly stable throughout, perceptions of past inflation and short-term expected inflation rates did increase in response to the inflation surges. In the event of a large inflation shock, an increase in near-term inflation expectations may take hold among households and firms, with firms anxious to avoid suffering relative price declines and households more likely to attribute individual price increases to general inflation than to a relative price increase. Indeed, the evidence suggests that there was a marked increase in the frequency of price increases over the course of 2022 (Chart 5).[15] This state-dependent increase in the frequency of price adjustments resulted in the faster-than-normal pass-through of the unique and large sectoral shocks. In terms of the key Phillips Curve macroeconomic relation between slack and inflation (whether at aggregate or sectoral levels), this can be interpreted as some combination of a shift up in the curve and an increase in the slope of the Phillips Curve. And indeed, estimates from a time-varying parameter model show some increase in the slope of the Phillips curve from early 2021 (Chart 6, left panel). Furthermore, the evidence based on sectoral data also shows a shift in the correlation between sectoral capacity utilisation and sectoral prices increases (Chart 6, right panel).[16] While the 2021-2022 inflation surges should not be interpreted as primarily originating in the recovery of product and labour markets from the 2020 pandemic lows, the domestic rebound added to overall inflationary pressures. I return to the contribution of domestic demand in the next section.

Right chart: services and manufacturing capacity utilisation are shown in deviation from the pre-COVID long-term average. Faced with large forecast errors and significant uncertainty, ECB staff worked to develop new models and enhance the scenario analysis in the policy process. The new models developed include models of underlying inflation, satellite models that allow for alternative transmission channels, and machine learning models that try to allow for important non-linearities.[17] Each of these approaches can help to cross-check projections from the main forecasting models. In turn, the staff judgement element in the forecasting process enables the incorporation of the results from these supplementary analytical exercises, both in the baseline and in the risk assessment. No doubt the lessons learned from the 2021-2022 high inflation episode will prove to be especially valuable in the future if a similar configuration of shocks were to arise. The recent experience certainly highlights the risks of over-reliance on baseline projections. Scenarios can be an effective way to represent risks when uncertainty is large or hard to quantify.[18] In 2020 and 2021, each set of quarterly staff projections included scenario analyses based on alternative assumptions regarding the future evolution of the pandemic and its economic consequences. In 2022, alternative scenarios focused on the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine, especially as regards uncertainties about energy supply. More recently, the scenario analysis has focused on more specific risks, such as a slowdown in the Chinese economy or a potential escalation of the conflict in the Red Sea area. In my May 2024 Stanford speech, I discussed how these alternative scenarios can be used to construct policy counterfactuals and will go into more details in a forthcoming speech on the use of scenarios to assess the robustness of alternative policy paths.[19] In addition to scenario analysis, the macroeconomic projections are accompanied by a large set of sensitivity analyses in relation to shifts in the technical assumptions and alternative parameter choices in model calibration. Demand versus supply shocks Models have also been deployed to interpret forecast errors through the lens of identified structural shocks and to quantify their contribution to inflation. Estimates from a large structural vector autoregressive (VAR) model – which employs sign and zero restrictions to identify the global and domestic demand and supply shocks driving deviations of inflation from the model-implied mean – indicate that external supply shocks were the main driver of the initial inflation surge in the euro area, although shocks to external demand and domestic demand also played a role, especially during 2022 (Chart 7).[20] In particular, the shock decomposition points to various phases. The initial inflation increase was mainly driven by global supply shocks, related to supply chain disruptions, surging oil and gas prices and higher commodity prices more generally. These results supported an initially-circumspect monetary policy response, as the central bank still gathered evidence about the persistence of the inflation shock and its likelihood to affect materially expectations and other behavioural relations in the economy. In particular, in the absence of a clear understanding of the nature and expected persistence of the shocks, a more patient and deliberate policy response that weighs up the risks to different options, appeared appropriate. In a second phase, the indirect effects from energy and food price spikes, as well as supply chain bottlenecks, passing through into core inflation led to the broadening of inflation pressures. Increasing demand, in particular in supply-constrained contact-intensive services, such as tourism and hospitality, added to inflationary pressures. Together with the risk that high inflation might de-stabilise inflation expectations, the increasing contribution of domestic demand add to the case for the aggressive monetary policy reaction that took place in this phase. In a third phase, as the energy and supply chain disruptions abated and monetary policy dampened demand, headline inflation started to decline rapidly. Chart 7 Supply and demand drivers of inflation dynamics (annual percentage changes and percentage change contributions; deviations from mean) Sources: Eurostat, ECB, Eurosystem, and ECB staff calculations. Notes: historical decomposition based on a large BVAR model accounting for a rich set of inflation drivers, identified with zero and sign restrictions, see Bańbura, M., Bobeica, E. and Martínez Hernández, C., (2024) “What drives core inflation? The role of supply shocks”, ECB Working Paper No. 2875. The chart shows the deviations of HICP inflation from the mean implied by the model. The latest observation is for September 2024. Of course, inference is sensitive to the type of model and the set of identifying assumptions.[21] A key challenge is to correctly capture the information set. A model needs to contain sufficient information to span the space of the structural shocks of interest. Otherwise, the correct shocks cannot be recovered from the history of observed variables. In stylised terms, the larger the model (or the more variables that are included), the more room there is to control for the different factors that affect inflation and, in particular, to separate out shocks from structural drivers. This is particularly relevant when inflation is driven by a multifaceted and unusual set of shocks and structural drivers, originating both at home and abroad, as was the case over the 2021-2022 period. The dramatic fallout from the pandemic and the rapid bounce back following the reopening of economies after lockdowns are cases in point. In turn, amongst its many other effects, the shock of the Russian invasion of Ukraine constituted an extraordinarily-disruptive supply shock to the energy sector. As it turns out, models that rely on a small information set tend to assign a stronger role to demand factors and predict over-smooth dynamics of inflation and growth because such small-scale models are not designed to capture the type of sudden changes witnessed in that episode.[22] The policy implications of model-based identification of demand and supply influences are not always easy to draw. That is, the policy implications not only depend on the source and nature of the shock but also its size and persistence. For example, a supply shock that is highly transitory (such as a temporary limitation in oil production in response to a short-lived geopolitical event) or a temporary surge in sectoral demand during the pandemic reopening phase (compounded by initially-limited supply capacity in the contact-intensive services sectors) may call for a looking-through policy response given the significant lags in the transmission of monetary policy.[23] By contrast, a string of large and persistent supply shocks in the same direction requires central banks to tighten in order to avoid longer-lasting inflation effects via wage-price spirals and dislocations in expectations. In relation to the latter risk, the de-anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations warrants close monitoring, and models can help policymakers understand the risks of de-anchoring under alternative shocks and scenarios. For instance, simulations using a regime-switching DSGE model suggest that substantial downward de-anchoring risks prevailed throughout most of 2021, due to the low inflation of the previous periods exerting a persistent dampening effect on expectations as well as the initial inflationary shocks being largely understood to be temporary in nature.[24] The further increase in inflation in early 2022 saw a rapid decline in downward de-anchoring risks and an increase in upward de-anchoring risks. The forceful policy response over the course of 2022 and 2023 helped to limit, and then reduce, these upward de-anchoring risks (Chart 8). Later on, risks became more balanced as inflation came down tangibly. Chart 8 Risks of de-anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations (percentage risk of upside and downside de-anchoring risks) Sources: ECB calculations based on Christoffel, K. and Farkas, M. (2025), “Managing the Risks of Inflation Expectation De-anchoring”, IMF Working Paper Series, 2025, forthcoming. Notes: The charts show the risk of de-anchoring for the staff projections from June 2021 to September 2024. The simulations are based on a regime switching version of the NAWM I (Christoffel, K., Coenen, G. and Warne, A. (2007)), where the credible regime is defined as the estimated version of the NAWM I, with a fixed inflation target, the de-anchored regime is characterised by a time varying inflation target. Upward de-anchoring is defined as a situation in a de-anchoring episode, where the perceived inflation target is above 2%. The share of de-anchoring is based on 1,000 simulations over a ten-quarter evaluation horizon. The latest observations are from the September 2024 MPE. The speed and strength of monetary policy transmission is also important when calibrating the appropriate monetary policy response.[25] Provided that monetary policy tightening transmits through to inflation in line with historical regularities, then our models should provide a good guide as to how fast and how far policy rates would need to be increased in response to the inflation shock. However, there is evidence that the aggressive rate hikes in response to inflation, and the highly restrictive monetary policy stance, have resulted in a faster-than-expected rise in lending rates as well as a larger contraction in credit flows, in particular to firms (Chart 9). This is important, because stronger-than-expected transmission would, all else being equal, call for smaller, or more gradual, rate increases in response to rising inflation.

Starting months correspond to the month immediately preceding the first hike, or explicit announcement of the hike, of the cycle. The hiking cycles considered are those starting in June 1988, October 1999, November 2005 and May 2022. Credit to firms is the sum of bank loans and debt securities. Bank loans are adjusted for sales and securitisation and cash pooling. Lending rates refer only to bank loans. The latest observations are for October 2024 for the policy rate and for September 2024 for lending rates, credit to firms and loans to households. Cross-checking the outlook with measures of underlying inflation The high level of uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook over the 2021-2022 period called for the development of additional metrics to distinguish between temporary and more long-lasting inflation dynamics. Models played an important role in the development of underlying measures of inflation, which aim to filter out the short-term volatility in headline inflation and better capture the low-frequency component of inflation. Such metrics provide a useful cross-check to the inflation projections, especially in times of elevated uncertainty. Most measures of underlying inflation have come down significantly from their peak (Chart 10).[26] Exclusion-based measures, which peaked around the beginning of 2023 have fallen steadily, and now sit just below three per cent. Model-based measures of Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI) measures, which have tended to perform the best in predicting HICP inflation since the pandemic, peaked earlier (around the middle of 2022) before declining quickly, and have now hovered around two per cent for several months.[27] In interpreting measures of underlying inflation, it is important to keep in mind that these can be temporarily distorted by the economy-wide impact of cost shocks such as bottlenecks and energy shocks. Models can be used to “partial out” these influences from the underlying inflation measures to give a better sense of the medium-term dynamics of inflation. These adjusted measures had a significantly lower peak rate of underlying inflation than the unadjusted measures but, by construction, were also less affected by the sharp turnaround in energy prices and easing of supply bottlenecks during 2023 that flattered the speed of progress in the unadjusted measures. Chart 10 Euro area underlying inflation measures and their adjusted counterpart Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations. Notes: HICPX stands for HICP inflation excluding energy and food; HICPXX for HICP inflation excluding energy, food, travel-related items, clothing and footwear; PCCI is the persistent and common component of inflation, while Supercore aggregates HICPX items sensitive to domestic business cycle. See also Bańbura et al. (2023), “Underlying inflation measures: an analytical guide for the euro area”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 5, ECB. The “adjusted” measures abstract from energy and supply-bottlenecks shocks using a large SVAR, see Bańbura, M., Bobeica, E. and Martínez-Hernández, C. (2023), “What drives core inflation? The role of supply shocks”, Working Paper Series, No 2875, ECB, November. The latest observation is for October 2024 (flash estimate) for HICPX, HICP excluding energy and HICP excluding unprocessed food and energy and September 2024 for the rest. It is also important to understand what the various measures tell us about the speed and sequencing of the disinflation process. The delayed and lagged adjustment in indicators such as services inflation, domestic inflation and wage growth highlight that convergence to the medium-term target may still take time. It will be important to continue to monitor developments in domestic inflation, which has declined only slowly, mainly due to the delayed adjustment in services inflation, which itself is closely linked to wage developments.[28] Policy counterfactuals The complex shocks that hit the euro area economy in 2021 and 2022 and the high inflation which emerged also raise the question of the appropriate monetary policy response of the ECB. This can be analysed by constructing policy counterfactuals that give an indication of what would have happened to inflation had the ECB acted differently. Staff use macroeconomic models to build these counterfactuals in real time, under different assumptions for the policy rate path and the expected path for inflation and growth. But the same models can also be used to construct counterfactuals with the benefit of hindsight, thus providing insight on what appropriate monetary policy might have looked like had the extent of the inflation surge been known from the outset. As an example, counterfactuals can be constructed using two policy models developed by ECB staff: the MMR model and the NAWM model.[29] Given projections for inflation and a measure of economic slack, as well as assumptions about the interest rate path, it is possible to construct policy paths that minimise a loss function featuring squared terms for the deviation of inflation from target, the output gap, and the change in the interest rate. The last term is a proxy for financial or other stress that could be created if the monetary stance changes very rapidly.[30] According to the model simulations, had the exact nature and size of shocks that were about to hit the economy been known back in the fourth quarter of 2021, the model-implied optimal policy (as defined by the minimisation of this loss function) would have called for interest rates to be increased earlier and more forcefully (Chart 11 black dashed). Inflation would have peaked at around 8 per cent rather than the 10 per cent observed in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, this tightening would have come with large output costs, with quarter-on-quarter growth rates 1 to 2 percentage points lower, depending on the model. Of course, the ECB did not possess perfect foresight. The projections by ECB and Eurosystem staff, as well as those of other forecasters, predicted much lower and less persistent inflation as the baseline. In looking at the policy paths that were constructed using the actual information available to policymakers at the time – as reflected in the ECB/Eurosystem staff projections for inflation and growth – it shows the actual interest rate path during the hiking cycle was broadly in line with the model-implied optimal policy path (Chart 11, blue lines vs. coloured lines).

(2023), op. cit.) with the exercises documented in the Handbook on Inflation (Coenen, Mazelis, Motto, Ristiniemi, Smets, Warne, Wouters (forthcoming)). Notes: “Baseline” denotes historical data available in the third quarter of 2024. The solid lines in the left-hand side chart are the counterfactuals in Q4 2021 and Q2 2022 from Chart 11. Each of the lines with a marker on the left panel is a counterfactual rate path computed by constraining the lift-date to match the actual one and letting policy evolve optimally afterwards. The lines on the right panel are the difference in impact on inflation between the unconstrained and constrained case. Two instances can be identified in the MMR model in which the model-implied optimal policy prescriptions differed slightly from the path of interest rates followed by the ECB. The first instance was in early 2022, when optimal policy would have called for interest rate hikes already in the first quarter. The implications of this delayed start to rate hikes can be assessed by comparing inflation outcomes under a counterfactual in which the optimal interest rate path is constrained not to increase until the time in which the ECB started increasing rates and under the alternative assumption that the rate path is unconstrained. The inflation outcomes in the two cases are very close to each other, in the order a few basis points, suggesting that small changes in the exact timing of lift off were not consequential: what matters in the model is the overall direction of travel of monetary policy rather than whether one rate action is brought forward or backward by one quarter. The second episode (not shown in the chart) was in September 2023 when the model-implied optimal policy would have called for one fewer interest rate hike. However, the model-implied optimal policy path should be checked against an array of risk considerations. The optimal policy paths above are drawn around the central tendency of the BMPE projections: especially during periods of high uncertainty about the macroeconomic outcomes, it is prudent to also consider alternative scenarios. In particular, choosing a policy path that avoids the worst scenario from happening is a form of insurance and can in practice call for either a more aggressive or more gradual policy response than indicated by a simple loss function that is conditioned on the baseline projections.[31] [32] Policy models can also be employed to compute counterfactuals to quantify the impact of the actual monetary policy tightening on the disinflation process. The exercise is conducted using the ECB’s main policy models – NAWM, MMR and ECB-BASE.[33] According to these models, without the unprecedented tightening, inflation would have been about two percentage points higher on average in each year between 2023 and 2026 (Chart 13). The exact effects of monetary policy on inflation and output are subject to significant uncertainty and depend, among other things, on the assumed expectations formation process in the model. Semi-structural models such as the ECB-BASE have typically more backward-looking expectations, resulting in a slower propagation of shocks and thus smaller effects from monetary policy. By contrast, the effects can be larger in DSGE models, such as NAWM and MMR due to the strong forward-looking behaviour of agents in these models. In addition, monetary policy likely had an additional important role in keeping long-term inflation expectations anchored: that is not incorporated in the quantification of the impact of policy tightening reported above.[34] The message emerging from these results indicates that monetary policy has played a significant role in contributing to the disinflation process and, given the information available at the time, it did so at a rather appropriate pace. As noted above, the policy simulations that condition on baseline projections alone suggest that the first increase in interest rates should have been implemented about a quarter earlier. But several other considerations beyond those captured in these models were relevant to the monetary policy decisions taken in the spring of 2022, especially in the context of the uncertainty surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A slightly earlier lift-off would only have had a very limited effect in dampening the scale of the inflation surge and a one quarter delay in liftoff provided insurance against the risks of tightening too early. Of course, as indicated earlier, the monetary policy tightening would have occurred at a significantly earlier date if the scale and persistence of the inflation shock had been better anticipated: the projections in early 2022 still signalled a return to below-target inflation over the medium term as they could not foresee as central tendency the protracted war in Ukraine and the drastic disruptions in the supply of Russian gas to some European countries. The final hike at the September 2023 meeting also incorporated risk management considerations.[35] In particular, in view of some signs of an increase in inflation risks over the course of the summer, it was judged to be safer to increase the policy rate by a further 25 basis points, which would reinforce progress towards the target for two basic reasons. First, if the economy evolved in line with the staff baseline case, the decision to hike would bolster confidence that inflation would return to target within the projection horizon. Second, a higher interest rate would more strongly limit the amplification of any upside shocks to the inflation path. In consequence, a more secure pace of disinflation and greater insurance against upside risks would also reinforce the anchoring of inflation expectations, which remained a precondition for the disinflation process to keep up its pace.

Conclusions My remarks today have sought to explain how macroeconomic models have been deployed at the ECB to help understand the 2021-2022 inflation surges and the appropriate monetary policy response. While models have their limitations, models can help us understand where and how our projections fell short. Models are also essential in the construction of scenarios and policy counterfactuals, which play an important role in the policy making process. The model-based analyses reported in this speech suggest that forecast errors in the inflation outlook were initially driven by unanticipated energy price shocks but that multiple changes in the transmission of shocks to inflation also played an important role in the broadening of the inflation shock, increasing its size and persistence. If the ECB had had perfect foresight in late 2021 on the exact nature and size of shocks that were about to hit the economy, the model-implied optimal policy would have called for interest rates to be increased more rapidly and more aggressively. Inflation would have peaked at around 8 per cent rather than the 10 per cent observed in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, this tightening would have come with large output costs, with quarter-on-quarter growth ending up 1 to 2 percentage points lower, depending on the model. Without the benefit of hindsight, the model-based analysis indicates that monetary policy was set in a broadly appropriate manner during 2021 and 2022, given the real-time information available to policymakers (including as incorporated in the baseline macroeconomic projections). While some risk considerations might have called for an earlier start to the hiking cycle, other risk considerations pushed in the opposite direction (including the uncertainty associated with the Russian invasion of Ukraine). In any event, the model analysis included in this speech suggests that minor variations in the start date would not have had a large impact. Most important, the interest rate path actually followed has delivered substantial and timely progress in disinflation.

By and large, the forecasting community (and market traders) significantly underestimated inflation over 2021 and 2022. This illustrates the significant challenges in forecasting inflation in a period characterised by extreme volatility in economic developments, and in energy commodity prices in particular. See Chart B in ECB (2024), “An update on the accuracy of recent Eurosystem/ECB staff projections for short-term inflation”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 2.. The Broad Macroeconomic Projection Exercise, or BMPE, is produced jointly by Eurosystem and ECB staff twice per year (in June and December), while in March and September, projections are produced by ECB staff (MPE). The market forward curve implicitly takes into account the expected impact of global monetary policies on the future path for commodity prices. Internal staff analysis indicates that ECB monetary policy has only a marginal impact on global oil prices. See ECB (2016), A guide to the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projection exercises , July. See also Ciccarelli, M., Darracq Paries, M. and Prifitis, R. (eds.) (2024), “ECB macroeconometric models for forecasting and policy analysis”, Occasional Paper series, No 344, ECB. The Basic Model Elasticities (BMEs) summarise the unconditional dynamics responses of variables across models used by NCBs and ECB staff. They do not come from a fully structural macroeconomic model. The specific approach adopted here uses BMEs from the NCBs in the Eurosystem that summarise the key relationships between projection variables. See ECB (2024), “An update on the accuracy of recent Eurosystem/ECB staff projections for short-term inflation”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 2 See Cicarelli et al (2019), ""Introducing ECB-BASE"", ECB Working paper No. 2315, September 2019. These counterfactual results may under-state the size of forecast errors not due to technical assumptions (i.e. model specific errors) because the conditioning is done on HICP energy inflation, rather than on the oil and gas price assumptions directly. The mapping of oil and gas price assumptions to HICP energy is done using satellite models, which may themselves suffer from model errors. The strong pass-through of wholesale energy prices to retail and service sectors may also have played a role during this period, particularly given the impact of gas supply disruptions on electricity prices as a result of the war. It is also possible that the level of uncertainty itself may be underestimated, especially since the ECB-BASE model was estimated on a 20-year sample (first quarter of 1995-fourth quarter of 2016), when inflation volatility was low. Uncertainty may have been significantly larger had the estimation sample included the 1970s. For example, results from estimating a structural VAR model reveal that the distribution of shocks to inflation since the COVID-19 pandemic has been significantly larger than during the period following the global financial crisis. This would imply that the economic relations may not have changed during the inflation surge, but rather that the shocks and parameter uncertainty have become larger than was assumed in the models. This, in turn, would imply a wider distribution around the inflation projections, which could render the difference between inflation outturns and model predictions statistically insignificant. Large cost shocks might both induce firms to increase the frequency of price adjustment in order to avoid making losses and increase the customer acceptance of price hikes, whereas prices might be less responsive to demand shocks.

From a theoretical perspective, Karadi et al. (2024) provide micro-foundations for a nonlinear Phillips curve whereby the sensitivity of inflation to activity increases after large shocks due to an endogenous rise in the frequency of price changes.

Allowing for transmission lags, a substantial tightening of monetary policy during 2021 might have tempered the 2022 post-pandemic rebound in the contact-intensive services sector. However, the level of uncertainty about the course of the pandemic remained elevated throughout 2021 and even in early 2022 due to the Omicron wave. Christoffel, K. and Farkas, M. (2025), ""Managing the Risks of Inflation Expectation De-anchoring"", IMF Working Paper Series, 2025, forthcoming. The still-high prominence of the risk of downside de-anchoring until March 2022 is connected to the assessment in these projection rounds that inflation would fall below target by the end of the projection horizon: that is, the rise in inflation was projected to be temporary.

(2024), ""Underlying inflation: an update"", speech at the Inflation: Dynamics and Drivers Conference 2024 organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the ECB, 24 October and Economic Bulletin, Issue 5, ECB, 2023. The importance of underlying inflation for monetary policy decision-making was highlighted in the 2021 monetary policy strategy review of the ECB. Model-based measures of the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI) are constructed by estimating a dynamic factor model that extracts the persistent and common component of inflation from granular price data at the item-country level, thereby exploiting the relative advantages of both cross-sectional and time series approaches. See Bańbura, M. and Bobeica, E. (2020), ""PCCI - a data-rich measure of underlying inflation in the euro area”, Statistics Paper Series, No 38, ECB, October. The PCCI is similar in spirit to the New York’s Fed Multivariate Core Trend. The PCCI is similar in spirit to the New York’s Fed Multivariate Core Trend. See Almuzara, M. and Sbordone, A.

The focus here is on the path for the policy rate, which is the primary policy instrument. A discussion of the associated adjustments in the additional policy instruments (bond purchase programmes, the targeted lending programme) is beyond the scope of this speech. The optimal policy counterfactuals in both models are conducted using the COPPs toolkit. For further details see de Groot, O., Mazelis, F., Motto, R. and Ristiniemi, A. (2021), “A toolkit for computing Constrained Optimal Policy Projections (COPPs)”, Working Paper Series, No 2555, ECB, May. The first of the two models used is the Mazelis, Motto and Ristiniemi (MMR) model, see see Mazelis, F., Motto, R. and Ristiniemi, A. (2023), “Monetary policy strategies for the euro area: optimal rules in the presence of the ELB”, Working Paper Series, No 2797, ECB, March, and the exercises are documented in the Handbook on Inflation (Coenen, Mazelis, Motto, Ristiniemi, Smets, Warne, Wouters (forthcoming)). For optimal policy simulations using the NAWM see Darracq Pariès, M., Kornprobst, A. and Priftis, R. (2024), “Monetary policy strategies to navigate post-pandemic inflation: an assessment using the ECB’s New Area-Wide Model”, Working Paper Series, No 2935, ECB, April. The loss function specification is consistent with common practice in academia and policy evaluations. The loss function weights used in the MMR model are estimated. The weight on inflation is 1, on the output gap 0.2, and the weight on the change in annualised interest rate 1.4. The weights used in the NAWM model are calibrated and are 1 for inflation, 0.1 for output gap, and 4 for the change in annualised interest rate. The insure perspective of the two instances highlighted above – the March 2022 and the September 2023 policy meetings – are well reflected in the Accounts of the monetary policy meetings. According to the ECB’s published Accounts of the policy meeting of March 2022, the uncertainty related to the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine was extensively debated, and I pointed out that “More than ever there was a need to maintain optionality in the conduct of monetary policy. In the current conditions, it was especially important for monetary policy to remain data-dependent and for optionality to be two-sided.” According to the Accounts of the ECB policy meeting of September 2023, I again pointed out that “[…] the choice between holding the deposit facility rate at 3.75% and moving to 4.00% was finely balanced. However, at the margin it was safer to decide on an additional hike, given the highly uncertain environment and the significant disinflation that was still required to return to the inflation target in a timely manner. […] In consequence, a more secure pace of disinflation and greater insurance against upside risks would also reinforce the anchoring of inflation expectations, which remained a precondition for the disinflation process to keep up its pace.” Risks to the baseline forecasts in an uncertain environment are typically explored through a robust control approach that compares policy for each of the scenarios and the risks of setting policy for a wrong scenario. Using a min-max strategy, it then chooses the policy option that avoids the worse outcome. For an application, see the forthcoming Handbook on Inflation (Coenen, Mazelis, Motto, Ristiniemi, Smets, Warne, Wouters (forthcoming)). An alternative approach is to create scenarios within a model by varying parameters and shocks and computing optimal policy on those scenarios. See Wieles, Kwakkel, Auping, Willem van den End (2024) “Scenario discovery to address deep uncertainty in monetary policy” DNB Working Paper No. 818.

Of course, optimal policy could also be studied under different model specifications, including allowing for nonlinearities. For instance, the frequency of price adjustment might be endogenous to the anticipated monetary policy response: see Karadi, P., Nakov, A., Nuño, G., Pasten, E. and Thaler, D.

In my concluding remarks, I will discuss a few issues raised during the conference. Understanding inflation dynamics is especially important today due to the surprisingly low inflation levels prevailing in many countries. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that in some countries, the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation seems to have weakened recently. In this context, a striking development is the emergence, of a “twin puzzle” after the Great Recession: first, “missing disinflation” from 2009 to 2011 (Coibion and Gorodnichenko, 2015), and second, “missing inflation or reflation” after 2012, particularly in Europe (Constâncio, 2015). During the Great Recession, inflation in advanced countries did not fall as much as the usual relation between inflation and economic slack, otherwise known as the Phillips curve, would have predicted, given the severity and length of the recession. Just as puzzling, more recent global developments point in the opposite direction. Between 2012 and 2017, both headline and core inflation in the euro area were lower than expected (i.e. lower than forecasted by the Eurosystem and other institutions). Despite the ongoing recovery, headline inflation rates in several advanced economies remain well below target. In light of these developments, the ESCB set up a network of experts to study the causes of this low inflation and to research the implications for policy (Ciccarelli and Osbat, 2017). That network has helped us to better understand inflation dynamics in the euro area. In particular, we now know that low inflation in the euro area had different origins: initially, it was mainly due to external factors (the fall in foreign demand, energy and food prices) while, after 2012, inflation was predominantly driven by domestic sources in an environment of weak demand. Still, a great deal remains to be understood. In this respect, the research presented at this conference has shed light on many angles. Several conference papers have added to our understanding of the drivers of inflation, the nature of inflation dynamics and inflation expectations, also highlighting how new data can help us improve our knowledge. The dynamics of inflation after the financial crisis and the apparent disconnect with real activity led to a belief that this relationship might have broken down or at least became unstable, for headline inflation as well as for core inflation and wages. From a policymaker’s perspective, such an apparent breakdown is serious. The presence of a structural Phillips curve relationship is part of the traditional transmission mechanism which central banks rely on to control inflation over the medium-term. The apparent disconnect between inflation and economic slack seems to have made interpreting and controlling inflation dynamics more difficult, with significant consequences for the conduct of monetary policy. Namely, the inflation trade-offs would worsen: on the one hand, if inflation rises as a result of cost-push shocks unrelated to domestic slack, then it would be more costly, in terms of output loss, to bring inflation down. On the other hand, the flip side is that a sharp dip in inflation would require a more substantial monetary policy stimulus, which in turn could be problematic given the lower bound on nominal interest rates. In sum, as I recently underlined, “a flatter slope of the Phillips curve would make controlling inflation either more costly or more difficult” (Constâncio, 2015). The reduced effect of economic slack is even more significant with regard to wages, a crucial factor of domestic underlying inflation. The fact that wages are not increasing more is an important puzzle in advanced economies. Higher wage increases were to be expected due to the strengthening of the economic recovery and are necessary in order to normalise inflation. In any case, changes in the Phillips curve over time make the work of the central bank more difficult, especially as they have to be understood in real time. Fortunately, in recent years, , the slope of the Phillips curve has been increasing somewhat in what regards headline inflation in the euro area, especially if we use a broad concept of unemployment (Unemployment 6, which is now at 18%) to measure economic slack. This points to one of the difficulties in using Phillips curves: the choice of an appropriate measure of slack which is a multidimensional reality. Many explanations have been put forward in the literature to rationalise the decrease of the Phillips curve coefficient of economic slack in all advanced economies. We can group them around three categories of factors: the increased importance of external shocks, including those related to globalisation; the enhanced role of expectations in influencing wage and price decisions, anchored by central bank targets, and finally, the existence of non-linearities and time-varying behaviour of different Phillips curve coefficients. I will touch upon these three aspects of the Phillips curve relationships that can be at the root of the recent inflation puzzles, trying to link them with the papers and discussions at this conference. . External shocks and exchange rate pass-through Let me start with external shocks or global drivers of inflation. There are several dimensions of the growing importance of international developments in influencing domestic inflation rates notably those related with economic and financial globalisation. Some economists have gone as far as to maintain that the global economic slack became more important than the domestic one to explain inflation to the point of significantly eroding the role of monetary policy in controlling inflation.[1] However, it is very difficult to capture, in quantitative analyses, all the effects of globalisation on inflation. The channels are various and as they overlap, not all of them can be included at the same time. First, one can list the increased import content of economic activity as trade grows, the extension of global value chains and the augmented input-output linkages across countries. These factors are most visible through the impact of oil prices on energy inflation. Energy accounts for around 10% of the consumer goods basket used to measure the HICP. Energy inflation is very closely linked to oil prices (See ECB Economic Bulletin article 4/2017: “Domestic and global drivers of inflation in the euro area”). And then there are the indirect effects of oil prices on domestic product costs, which can then work their way through the supply chain to influence headline inflation. The global influence is, of course, not limited to oil and energy. Food prices in the euro area are affected by global food prices and prices of imported consumer goods are important for domestic inflation as well. The prices of imported goods and services directly affect headline inflation via their shares in final consumption and indirectly via their use as intermediate products. Beyond commodity prices, the role of import prices has been enhanced by the extension of global value chains and the linkages that this creates. The paper by Auer and co-authors (2017) presented at this conference illustrates this point well. Starting from the worldwide synchronisation of producer price inflation (PPI), they conclude that input-output linkages explain 50% of the global component of PPI. In another recent BIS paper, Auer, Borio and Filardo (2017) show how the relevance of global value chains explains why the contribution of the global economic slack has gained importance. Nevertheless, the analysis of Bianchi and Civelli (2015) for 50 countries from 1971 to 2006, casts some doubt about the global slack coefficient having a consistent increase accompanying the progress of globalisation. Only when the two hypotheses of a decreasing significance of the domestic slack and the increased importance of the global slack are jointly tested, do they find “that in fact trade openness enhances the relative importance of the foreign output gap on domestic inflation” However, Ciccarelli and Mojon (2010) and Ferroni and Mojon (2014) had previously shown that the commonality of inflation globally goes beyond what can be captured by commodity prices. They also report that the global inflation factor would improve forecasts of domestic inflation in different specifications, from augmenting an AR (1) model to using it in Phillips curve or BVARs. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the importance of the common factor does not depend on spillovers among countries but is rather the result of common shocks and convergence of monetary policy frameworks around the world. One could perhaps add that the subdued behaviour of wages can be partially attributable to a common factor related to the loss of labour pricing power at the national level, stemming from the relocation threat. Moreover, the way in which exchange rate movements pass through into import prices at the border and at the final consumer level is also critically important to understand the influence of external shocks on inflation. Consequently, understanding exchange rate pass-through into aggregate prices is vital for forecasting inflation and setting monetary policy. In this conference, the paper by Forbes et al. (2017)[2] shows that the Exchange Rate Pass-Through (ERPT) is variable, both across countries and across time. For policymakers this is a challenge, as it makes it significantly more difficult to predict the effect of fluctuations in currency markets on domestic inflation. However, an important insight from this paper and also previous work by Kristin Forbes and co-authors is that the ERPT to inflation may differ depending on the nature of the shocks that triggered the exchange rate movement, as it may reflect different transmission channels.[3] The empirical evidence confirms that different shocks exert different effects on inflation, possibly even leading to inflation responses in the opposite direction of the exchange rate movement. For instance, results in the ESCB LIFT task force (Ciccarelli and Osbat 2017) point to a significantly higher ERPT than on average in case of a monetary policy induced currency appreciation, and even to upward pressure on prices following an appreciation driven by domestic demand. In the latter case, the direct impact of domestic demand on inflation dominates the one stemming from the exchange rate. This insight is especially relevant for the euro area, as it suggests that the recent euro appreciation may have a more limited dampening effect on inflation than what would be implied by historical averages. Finally, I would like to mention the paper presented by Laseen and Sanjani (2016) that analyses whether the financial crisis, together with globalisation has broken the Phillips curve in the U.S. the economy in which traditional reduced form single equations have shown the highest decline in the economic slack parameter. Using multivariate, time-varying methods (a large BVAR, a DFM and a MS-BVAR) they show that changes in shocks of other variables are “a more salient feature of the data than changes in coefficients”. This is encouraging as it implies that, although financial and external variables have the highest forecasting power for inflation after the crisis, their effect could be more relevant in the short-term, leaving the coefficient of the economic slack in the Phillips curve still significant. In regime-switching models they show that “what changes across regimes is most importantly the variances of structural disturbances”. Together with the slight steepening of the Phillips curve in the euro area, this gives some hope that the future closing of the output gap will allow us to gradually reach our inflation target. In any case, as stated by the ECB President in the latest ECB press conference: “a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to gradually build up and support headline inflation developments in the medium-term”. Insights from household inflation expectations Modern macroeconomic models attribute a central role to inflation expectations in price and wage setting. This literature has stressed the management of inflation expectations as a crucial monetary policy channel, and the importance of central bank credibility. When forward-looking agents expect the central bank to stabilise future inflation, they also react less to current disturbances in adjusting prices and wages, leading to more stable inflation outcomes. Therefore, an important element determining the effectiveness of monetary policy is the trust of the public in the commitment and the ability of the central bank to reach its target in the medium-term. In turn, measures of long-term inflation expectations are invaluable in helping to understand if expectations are well anchored. The novelty of the work by Christelis, Georgarakos, Japelli and van Rooij presented in this conference, is that they measure both trust in the ECB and inflation expectations of individual consumers through a specifically designed survey. Indeed, their findings are reassuring because they establish a clear link between high levels of trust and inflation expectations that are anchored around the medium-term inflation target. Specifically, they find that trusting the ECB increases inflation expectations when these are below the ECB’s inflation objective, and lowers them when they are above it. Moreover, higher trust in the ECB significantly reduces uncertainty about future inflation. Their findings suggest that a central bank can influence the economy through people’s expectations, even in times when conventional monetary policy tools likely have weak effects. This is certainly very encouraging for policymakers. The literature has also made some progress in incorporating data on actual inflation expectations into macro models, usually relying on survey data. In earlier work, Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015) suggested a solution to the “missing disinflation” in the U.S., showing that household inflation expectations from 2009 to 2011 remained elevated, reflecting the increase in oil prices at the time. This conference has featured the paper by Slobodoyan and Wouters[4] which embeds inflation expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters in a New Keynesian model with learning. This paper makes a strong case for entering survey expectations data into the standard dataset on which these macro-models should be estimated. What we learn is that survey information improves the model forecast for both inflation and the other macroeconomic variables, especially when expectations are modelled based on adaptive learning. The work by Coibion and Gorodnichenko I mentioned before points to a source of stickiness in the formation of consumer inflation expectations that can lead to more stable inflation outcomes, independently of monetary policy actions, sometimes helping the monetary authority in achieving its inflation objective, sometimes making it more difficult. In this vein, the work by Weber and co-authors shows us that not all price changes are treated equally by households in forming their inflation expectations. Price changes that are more readily observed such as those that are larger or that are from goods that are purchased more frequently are more important in shaping inflation expectations. To some extent, the large cross-sectional variation of inflation expectations among households is somewhat worrisome for the policymaker, especially if (as the Weber et al. and the paper by Vellekoop and Wiederholt[5] suggest) people change their consumption behaviour and make financial decisions based on these expectations. For policymakers, this seems to suggest that there is an important role of the central bank in shaping the expectations of the general public, not only that of financial markets. It also suggests that more research is needed to understand the different factors that shape the inflation expectations of individual households, in particular the role of volatile sub-series of the HICP in shaping the inflation expectations of the general public and on the decisions that households make, based on their inflation expectations. Only more detailed data that matches inflation expectations of households with their decisions will be able to shed more light on this issue. Building better models of nominal price rigidities This brings me to the last point of improving structural models of the Phillips curve, and the importance of non-linearities, particularly those that result from considering state-dependency of the Phillips curve and the possible different behaviour of price stickiness in different phases of the business cycle. Practically all models that are considered to be the core of modern monetary macroeconomics rely on the assumption of nominal rigidities, i.e. the fact that prices do not immediately adjust to changes in costs and demand. In such models, price stickiness is the ultimate cause of why monetary impulses have real effects and are transmitted slowly through the economy. Understanding the degree to which prices are sticky or inflation is persistent is important for central banks as it determines how interest rates need to be set to achieve the desired level of inflation. Still, the exact nature and mechanisms that are at the core of price stickiness continue to be imperfectly understood. The debate among macro-economists on the foundations of nominal price rigidities, and therefore how to model them, is ongoing and far from settled. This is important for our understanding of the Phillips curve from a structural point of view, going beyond a simple correlation between inflation and economic activity. The structural Phillips curve relationship that comes out of the different models of nominal rigidities can be very different. These differences have implications for determining the degree of price stickiness and thus the slope of the Phillips curve. In general, time-dependent and state-dependent models have radically different implications in terms of the determinants of the slope of the Phillips curve, and its sensitivity to the business cycle. In line with the predictions of state-dependent models of price setting, recent research has shown that several features of the distribution of price changes vary over the business cycle (Berger and Vavra 2015). This would imply that the degree of price stickiness and thus the degree of non-neutrality of monetary policy is also different in expansions and recessions. This is a great example of how micro data can provide crucial evidence on nonlinearities that would be more difficult to detect decisively with less granular and more aggregate data. There is some evidence at the aggregate level that the slope of the Phillips curve might have changed during the period when we were over-predicting inflation. For the euro area, the evidence from several new papers points to a relative steepening recently, following the previous flattening, (see e.g. Oinonen and Paloviita (2014), Riggi and Venditti (2015) and Foroni and Porqueddu (2015)). This development is especially marked in those countries which experienced deeper and longer recessions and made greater efforts to reform their product and labour markets. Estimating the same specifications of Phillips curves over two samples, one stopping at 2012 Q1 (when we started systematically over-predicting inflation) and the other covering a longer sample, one finds evidence of an increase in the slope estimate. Indeed, regime-switching estimates, accounting for parameter change depending on the state of the business cycle, can help to explain the “excessive” disinflation since 2012 and justify the expectations about future normalisation. Concluding remarks Let me conclude. The findings of many papers in this conference would not have been possible without the use of detailed micro data. Micro data help us identify the channels of transmission better, such as when household expectations determine household choices or when micro price allow us to build better micro-founded models. The Eurosystem has already previously organised a number of large-scale research efforts with the aim of better understanding prices and price-setting at the micro-level: the Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network (Angeloni et al. (2006); Álvarez et al. (2006); Dhyne et al (2006); Fabiani et al (2007); Vermeulen et al (2012)), and an expert group studying Nielsen scanner data in 2012 (ECB, Economic Bulletin, Issue I, 2015). There is a lot of potential for research on price-setting behaviour, especially given the recent opportunities to enhance access to relevant data. This is why we have made micro-price research a strategic priority in our research work plan for the next three years. A primary task will be a renewed effort in collecting a wealth of new price micro data for the euro area countries. The contribution of academic research to this ambitious agenda will be vital, and this conference is a great example of how much we can benefit from it. References Álvarez, L., E. Dhyne, M.

The energy shock stemming from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has prolonged and aggravated a sequence of unprecedented supply shocks.[1] These shocks, combined with the reopening of the economy after the pandemic, have driven inflation in the euro area to persistently high levels.[2] To prevent inflation from becoming entrenched, the ECB tightened its monetary policy stance decisively. We needed to avert second-round effects in the form of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations or a wage-price spiral. We started to adjust our stance in December 2021[3]. Since July we have increased rates by 300 basis points. We have also started to normalise our balance sheet, which has shrunk by about €1 trillion since its peak. And from March we will reduce our asset purchase programme holdings by an average of €15 billion per month[4]. After this pronounced tightening, we need to carefully reassess the medium-term outlook for inflation and the risks surrounding it. In this respect, risks to the inflation outlook are now more balanced than at the time of our projections in December. The economic environment is changing. Supply shocks have started to reverse, with energy and food commodity prices receding from their peaks last year and supply bottlenecks easing. It will take time for this to be fully reflected in retail prices across the economy and ultimately in core inflation. We also face formidable sources of economic and geopolitical uncertainty globally. And major central banks are tightening their monetary policy stance simultaneously, the overall effects of which are difficult to assess. In the euro area, market rates have increased significantly and bank lending is decelerating sharply. While housing and business investment has already weakened, the effect of our monetary policy impulses on domestic demand will only be felt in full over the coming quarters. In this setting, I will argue that the ECB should not unconditionally pre-commit to future policy moves. Instead, we need to calibrate our monetary policy in a way that is data-dependent, forward-looking and adaptable to changing developments. This approach can be best implemented by providing clarity on our monetary policy reaction function and then being guided by that reaction function in our decisions. We should respond to incoming information on the medium-term inflation outlook and the balance of risks surrounding it. And we should keep our policy tight until we see inflation firmly converging back to 2% over our policy horizon, taking into account the lags with which our monetary policy operates. When we were normalising rates the pace of adjustment was key. But with rates now moving into restrictive territory, it is the extent and duration of monetary policy restriction that matters. By smoothing our policy rate hikes – that is, moving in small steps – we can ensure that we calibrate both elements more precisely in the light of the incoming information and our reaction function. This framework will allow us to return to our target without undue delay. And it will allow us to do so at minimal cost to the economy and employment, reducing the risk that we tighten too much. The uncertain economic environment The current uncertain economic environment makes forecasting inflation particularly challenging. The medium-term inflation outlook was revised substantially upwards in our staff projections last December. Headline inflation was projected to stand at 3.4% in 2024, before falling to 2% in the third quarter of 2025 (Chart 1). And core inflation was expected to remain above target throughout our horizon, declining to 2.4% on average by 2025. The risks to this outlook were primarily on the upside. Chart 1 Euro area HICP headline inflation and inflation projections (annual percentage changes and percentage point contributions) Source: Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, December 2022. Notes: The dashed yellow line denotes projections. The latest observations are for the fourth quarter of 2022. But key assumptions underpinning economic projections can change quickly. In fact, recent surveys and the latest European Commission forecast see headline inflation significantly below our December projections for 2024.[5] And risks have become more balanced. Let me now review the key factors making projections difficult in the current environment. Energy prices Energy inflation has slowed more than projected in December. As a result, headline inflation is also falling: in January it was well below what we expected in December, driven by the energy component (Chart 2). If the drop in energy prices is sustained, headline inflation may fall below 3% towards the end of the year. Chart 2 Inflation in the euro area (annual percentage changes and percentage point contributions) Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.Note: NEIG stands for “non-energy industrial goods”. The deceleration in headline inflation is particularly visible from indicators of inflation momentum, which may be more informative than the usual year-on-year inflation rate when inflation is changing rapidly.[6] These indicators are also showing signs of deceleration in core inflation (Chart 3). Chart 3 Short-run inflation momentum: three-month HICP change, annualised, working-day and seasonally adjusted (percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat and ECB. Note: The latest observation is for December 2022. Wholesale electricity and gas prices are currently lower than assumed in the December projections, pointing to a continued decline in energy inflation. And wholesale energy prices will affect all inflation components as they remain the largest driver of both goods and services inflation (Chart 4). Chart 4 Contributions of energy-sensitive components to goods and services inflation in the euro area (annual percentage changes and percentage point contributions) Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations. Notes: The term “energy-sensitive component” reflects items with a share of energy in direct costs above the average share of energy across services items (left-hand panel) and non-energy industrial goods (NEIG) items (right-hand panel). The latest observations are for December 2022 Core inflation has been less affected by the fall in energy prices so far. This is not surprising, as energy typically has a gradual and indirect impact on the price of goods and services through changes in the cost of inputs. For example, the cost of offering goods will over time benefit from lower transportation costs. Similarly, the cost of producing food will benefit from lower fertiliser costs, and the cost of providing hospitality services will benefit from lower heating costs. Core inflation cannot turn on a dime, and the speed at which lower energy prices will pass through to core inflation is uncertain. If lower energy prices strengthen consumer demand, the pass-through could be slower as firms seize the opportunity to increase margins. At the same time, over the past year we have seen more frequent price adjustments, which could make downward price rigidities less binding. In any case, the direction of core inflation will eventually follow that of headline inflation, just like what happened on the way up. Lower energy prices will help to temper core inflation through other channels too. For example, improving terms of trade due to lower energy prices have contributed to the euro’s appreciation both directly[7] and indirectly by supporting the growth outlook (Chart 5). In turn, the appreciation of the euro against the dollar – by 12% from the through in September and 4% since the December projections – further reduces the cost of dollar-denominated commodities and other inputs imported in the euro area[8]. Chart 5 Drivers of the euro-US dollar exchange rate (cumulative changes since January 2022, percentage changes and percentage point contributions) Sources: ECB and ECB calculations. Notes: A decrease denotes a euro depreciation against the US dollar. The decomposition of exchange rate changes is based on an extended two-country Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) model including ten-year euro area overnight index swap rate, euro area stock price, EUR/USD, ten-year euro area overnight index swap-US Treasury spread, US stock prices and the relative Citi commodities terms-of-trade index in the euro area compared with the United States. An adverse euro area terms-of-trade shock is assumed to depreciate the euro against the dollar, reduce euro area equity prices, and increase euro area yields and yield spreads against the United States. Identification via sign and narrative restrictions, using daily data. “Dec. projections” refers to the December 2022 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. The latest observation is for 10 February 2023. Moreover, current developments alleviate the concerns that high energy prices could lead to a loss of potential output and thus exacerbate inflationary pressures[9]. I recently argued that this was still a conjecture rather than a fact.[10] But if energy prices continue to fall, potential output will prove more resilient. In my view, even though we need to be cautious as energy prices are highly volatile, recent developments in energy markets have made the risks surrounding the inflation outlook more balanced. Fiscal measures One major factor behind the upward revision to the December inflation projections for 2024-25 was the assessment made by Eurosystem staff about the fiscal measures taken since 2022 to attenuate the impact of the energy shock. The projections foresaw that the price-based measures – introduced or announced by governments in order to contain changes in consumers’ purchasing power over time – would reduce inflation this year. The projections also reflected the expectation that the bulk of these measures would be withdrawn next year, increasing inflation by 0.7 percentage points in 2024 and generating significant carry-over effects for 2025. And this delayed the moment at which inflation was projected to return to our 2% target, with important implications for our monetary policy decisions. Moreover, according to the projections, most of these measures would not be limited to vulnerable population groups, potentially creating an expansionary impulse for demand. As I argued recently[11], this risked creating a highly inefficient interaction between monetary and fiscal policies. Fiscal measures that were introduced to protect consumers’ purchasing power might paradoxically trigger a contractionary monetary policy reaction that would hit the real economy, reducing household incomes and increasing the interest bill for governments. This would be like giving with one hand and taking away with the other. This assessment of the inflationary effects of the fiscal measures is however surrounded by high uncertainty. Discretionary fiscal spending is hard to predict accurately, and the measures could be adjusted to avoid inefficient interactions with monetary policy. Indeed, some governments have announced that they may reduce spending on energy price brakes or move to more targeted income-based measures. Moreover, falling energy prices are likely to imply that energy support measures will be less extensive than foreseen in the December projections. This is also contributing to the rebalancing of risks to inflation. Wage developments Another factor that drove up our projections was wage growth. As workers sought compensation for high inflation, we expected wages to accelerate. This robust wage dynamic boosted the baseline projection and the risks surrounding it, as accelerating wages coupled with a tight labour market could raise the spectre of a wage-price spiral. Wages are still a source of upside risk. In the seven countries covered by the ECB’s wage tracker, recently concluded agreements signal that wage pressures are rising (Chart 6), albeit remaining consistent with the December projections. Chart 6 Wage developments (annual percentage changes) Sources: Left panel: Eurostat, ECB, national sources. The difference between the ECB wage tracker and negotiated wage growth series in 2022 is mostly due to different series of negotiated wage growth for France, with the ECB euro area tracker using wage growth in sectoral negotiations in France. Data on Indeed wage trackers can be found here. Right panel: Calculations based on micro data on wage agreements provided by Bundesbank, Banco de España, the Dutch employer association AWVN, Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Bank of Greece, Banca d’Italia and Banque de France. Data for FR are based on an updated version of Gautier, E. (2022): “Negotiated wage rises for 2022: the results so far”, Eco Notepad, No 269, Banque de France. Notes: Euro area aggregate is based on ES, IT, GR, AT, DE, NL and FR. The latest observations are November 2022 for negotiated wages (excluding NL), fourth quarter of 2022 for the wage trackers. But so far there is no convincing evidence that inflation expectations are de-anchoring, which is a necessary condition for a wage-spiral to take hold. Survey evidence suggests that consumers expect inflation to moderate over the medium term.[12] And longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored.[13] The upside movement in wages might reflect a one-off rebalancing in the income distribution between workers and firms. Workers have so far borne the brunt of the “Putin tax”, suffering a large loss of real income while, on balance, firms’ mark-ups remained stable or even increased in some sectors.[14] Ultimately, the “tax” will be absorbed by the factors of production – labour and capital – in proportion to their respective bargaining power in the labour market. Moreover, lower energy prices limit workers’ loss of real income, thereby containing their drive to seek compensation through higher wages. And lower energy bills reduce input costs, allowing firms to better absorb wage increases without having to raise prices in response. In this way, we could see strong one-off wage growth but limited aggregate “cost-push” effects that raise core inflation. All in all, higher wage increases do not necessarily signal a persistent divergence from our 2% inflation target. But we cannot rule out that stronger and sustained wage dynamics will take hold if above-target inflation proves to be persistent. I consider this risk broadly unchanged compared with the December projections. Risks to the growth outlook The same supply shocks that are rebalancing the risks to inflation are also rebalancing the risks to growth. Since December, economic activity and labour markets have proven more resilient than expected. And the outlook may improve further as lower energy prices support the economy and economic confidence in the current context of robust job growth. That could reduce the downside pressure on the prices of core goods and services. These positive developments could be partly counterbalanced by the appreciation of the exchange rate and the tightening of credit conditions observed in recent months. And macro-econometric models may only partially capture the contractionary effects of our sizeable monetary policy tightening.[15] There is also high uncertainty surrounding the international environment. While the US economy is decelerating, its labour market has recently surprised on the upside. In China, the exit from zero-COVID policy has led to a wave of infections that have adversely affected the economy, but the outlook is expected to improve as the economy reopens. More broadly, global demand and supply remain difficult to predict in view of geopolitical unknowns and the synchronised tightening by major central banks across the world.[16] In short, the next steps facing monetary policy are anything but obvious. A data-dependent monetary policy with a clear reaction function So how should policy respond to this environment? The benefits of data dependency There are times when it makes sense to commit to a specific future course of monetary policy action – this is what we call forward guidance. That is the case when the economy faces deflationary risks and interest rates are at their lower bound.[17] And it can also be true when faced with inflationary risks: if the outlook changes rapidly and the monetary stance becomes clearly inappropriate, the commitment to normalise policy rates quickly is key to anchor inflation expectations.[18] But today we are in a different situation. Monetary policy has already made a sizeable adjustment, and we now face inflation uncertainty in both directions. Moreover, we are not constrained in using interest rates to return to our target. Forward guidance is therefore unnecessary. In fact, it would be tantamount to tying our own hands at a time when the inflation outlook can change rapidly. In such circumstances, a truly data-dependent approach to calibrating monetary policy is preferable since it enables us to react nimbly to the incoming data. And it gives us enough time to see how our decisions affect the wider economy – a process that is hard to assess today. Given the extent and speed of our tightening so far, there is a question mark over just how fast and how strong its effects on the economy will be. Very early evidence suggests that bank lending rates are increasing more quickly than in previous hiking cycles, in line with the steeper increase in policy rates. And lending to firms and households is decelerating rapidly (Chart 7). Chart 7 Key macro-financial variables during hiking cycles (cumulative changes in percentage points for policy and lending rates; index (t=1) for total credit to firms and loans to households for house purchase) Sources: ECB, Eurostat and ECB calculations. Notes: The ECB-relevant policy rate is the Lombard rate up to December 1998, the MRO up to May 2014 and the DFR thereafter. Total credit to firms includes borrowing from banks and debt securities issued by non-financial corporations. Monetary financial institution loans to firms and households are adjusted for sales, securitisation and cash pooling. Data for debt securities and private residential investment before 1989 are not available and have been estimated. Latest observations are December 2022 for lending rates and loans, January 2022 for HICP and February 2022 for the DFR. But given the long lags with which monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy,[19] most of the effects of our tightening are still ahead of us. This means, for example, that the current adjustment in the credit market – involving higher loan rates, as well as tighter lending standards and lower demand for loans to firms and households (Charts 8 and 9) – will likely compress consumption and investment in the coming months. Chart 8 Changes in credit standards and demand for loans to euro area firms (net percentages) Source: Bank Lending Survey (BLS). Notes: The net percentage for credit standards refers to the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “tightened considerably” and “tightened somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “eased somewhat” and “eased considerably”. The net percentage for loan demand refers to the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “increased considerably” and “increased somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “decreased somewhat” and “decreased considerably"". Net percentages for the “Other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards. Latest observation: January 2023 BLS. Chart 9 Changes in credit standards and demand for loans to euro area households for house purchases (net percentages) Source: BLS. Notes: The net percentage for credit standards refers to the difference between the sum of the percentages of banks responding “tightened considerably” and “tightened somewhat” and the sum of the percentages of banks responding “eased somewhat” and “eased considerably”.

Net percentages for the “Other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards. Latest observation: January 2023 BLS. In the light of this, we increasingly need to consider the risk of overtightening. After many years of low growth, tipping the economy into a full-scale recession could trigger a permanent destruction of productive capacity and harm future employment opportunities, especially for the vulnerable members of society. Even if subsequently corrected, such overtightening would be very costly, given the low flexibility of the European economy.[20] Overall, monetary policy needs to react forcefully when major shocks hit the economy and push inflation in a clear direction. But when risks are more balanced, a data-dependent approach is a prerequisite to avoiding costly mistakes. Clarifying the reaction function For such a data-dependent approach to be effective and avoid exacerbating uncertainty, we need to give some guidance on our future policy. Although we should avoid giving unconditional forward guidance on the policy rate path many months ahead, a meeting-by-meeting approach alone may not suffice. It may leave investors in the dark, having to guess our future moves and focusing on the near term[21]. To deal with this conundrum, we must instead provide investors with a framework for how we evaluate and respond to the incoming information. In other words, we need to clarify our reaction function. In line with our price stability mandate, our reaction function is informed by the inflation outlook as well as the risks surrounding it. And it is designed to ensure that inflation returns to 2% without undue delay, taking into account the lags with which our monetary policy operates. A proper understanding of this reaction function can benefit from two important clarifications. The first is what will contribute to determining our reaction – that is, the set of factors that will affect inflation the most at our medium-term policy horizon[22]. At the global level, the most significant of these factors are energy prices, simply because lower energy prices are crucial for current inflationary pressures to unwind. As for the domestic economy, a key factor in the coming months will be how rapidly lower energy prices and the associated lower cost pressures for firms are passed on to retail prices. In this respect, we need to carefully monitor mark-ups and wage growth, which could push in the opposite direction; for wages, we need to distinguish one-off adjustments from generalised increases, which could trigger self-sustaining wage-price rises. The conditions in the credit market are also important: we need to assess how fast credit to the economy is contracting and what its effects are on consumption and investment. Second, we need to clarify how we should react to new information. Last year, the need to normalise monetary policy quickly from a very accommodative starting point placed emphasis on the pace of rate hikes to prevent inflation becoming entrenched. But now that we have made a major policy adjustment, the extent and duration of restriction have become increasingly relevant. By smoothing our policy rate hikes – that is, moving in small steps – we can ensure that we calibrate these two elements more precisely, remaining truly data-dependent and avoiding mistakes. This means that we will need to act in a non-mechanical way, keeping a genuine forward-looking approach and avoiding overreacting to individual data points. We also need to ensure consistency across our tools. It is natural to normalise the size of the balance sheet in a tightening phase, thereby making it “push” in the same direction as our interest rate policy. But we are in unprecedented territory, and the pace of normalisation should be gradual and prudent, with rates remaining the key instrument to steer our monetary stance. There is little reliable experience of balance sheet tightening. It is hard to assess how a contraction of our balance sheet will affect bond markets and financial stability – especially if it happens in conjunction with an abrupt increase in interest rates. What we do know is that we must preserve the singleness of our monetary policy by ensuring that our policy impulse is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries. We should remain committed to all our lines of defence, which reinforce each other. First, a measured approach to hikes and balance sheet normalisation. Second, the flexibility embedded in our reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme. And third, the Transmission Protection Instrument. Conclusion Let me conclude. The energy shock has coincided with the post-pandemic reopening of the economy to result in persistently high inflation in the euro area. That in turn has increased the risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations and inflationary wage-price dynamics. In response, we have tightened our monetary policy decisively to prevent inflation becoming entrenched in the economy. But as policy rates move more firmly into restrictive territory and the energy shock abates, the risks to the inflation outlook have become more balanced. And the outlook for the economy and inflation has become increasingly uncertain, both globally and in the euro area. In this environment, we no longer need to overweight upside risks to avoid worst-case scenarios. We now need to take into account the risk of overtightening alongside the risk of doing too little. A data-dependent calibration of monetary policy – firmly rooted in a clear reaction function – offers the best way forward. It will enable us to clarify our policy intentions, providing markets with the necessary guidance while keeping volatility in check. In parallel, by smoothing our policy moves we ensure that their cost to the economy is minimal. This doesn’t mean we will not be resolute in the fight against inflation. It means being resolute in the right direction. What we do not want is “to drive like crazy at night with our headlights turned off” – as Italian singer Lucio Battisti once put it.[23] Thank you.

In December 2021 we announced a step-by-step reduction in net asset purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) and the discontinuation of net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme at the end of March 2022. In March 2022 we accelerated the reduction of net purchases under the APP and in April we pre-announced their discontinuation in the third quarter. In July we raised the ECB key interest rates for the first time in 11 years. This pace applies until the end of June. The subsequent pace of portfolio reduction will be determined over time. The Survey of Professional Forecasters for the first quarter of 2023 sees inflation at 2.7% in 2024 (0.7 percentage points below our projection) and at 2.1% in 2025. The Survey of Monetary Analysts for February 2023 sees inflation back to 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2.0% in the first quarter of 2025. The European Commission’s Winter 2023 Economic Forecast projects inflation at 2.5% in 2024. When inflation changes rapidly, either upwards or downwards, the year-on-year inflation rates that are typically used in the public debate (i.e. the change in prices compared with one year ago) may not be very informative about the current change in the prices of goods and services. This reflects the fact that year-on-year inflation rates may give too much weight to data that are too far in the past. In such a situation, it is useful to get an indication about turning points by also looking at more recent inflation developments, including changes in prices over a period of three months or six months based on seasonally adjusted data. However, such shorter time horizons give more weight to recent shocks, some of which may be temporary. As euro area energy and commodity imports are often dollar-denominated, lower energy and commodity prices reduce the demand for dollars. It should however be noted that dollar-denominated commodity prices are, at least in part, jointly determined with euro-dollar exchange rate in global financial markets. In theory, permanently higher energy prices could lower potential output, for instance by making energy-intensive production technology unprofitable. However, there is no clear empirical evidence that oil price shocks have a lasting effect on potential output and recent analysis by ECB staff suggests that shocks analogous to those seen in recent months are likely to have limited effects on potential output, and that those effects are surrounded by considerable uncertainty.

The current extraordinary situation poses a challenge to conventional tools in assessing the macroeconomic ramification of the sharp and sizeable re-orientation of the monetary policy posture and its effects on the various channels through which it affects demand and inflation (exchange rate, consumption, investment, expectations, bank lending, assets prices, etc.). A set of models designed to assess the impact of monetary policy suggests that the tightening may have significantly larger effects than estimated through standard projection tools. See Dieppe A. and Brignone D. (2022), “Synchronised interest rate hikes, spillovers and risks to global growth”, VoxEU, 14 November, and Panetta, F. (2022), “Mind the step: calibrating monetary policy in a volatile environment”, speech at the ECB Money Market Conference, 3 November. In this setting, one way to engineer a looser monetary stance is to act on expectations of future rates by signalling that policy rates will remain low for a long time. Equally, when inflation risks are heavily to the upside, there is a case for programming a series of hikes to avoid an inflationary spiral. Model-based analysis by ECB staff suggests that, on average, the impact of a rate hike on inflation builds up gradually over time to reach its peak during the second year following the initial shock. See Lane, P. (2022), “The transmission of monetary policy”, speech at the SUERF, CGEG COLUMBIA SIPA, EIB, SOCIÉTÉ GÉNÉRALE conference on “EU and US Perspectives: New Directions for Economic Policy”, 11 October. Empirical analyses show that the euro area is typically slower to recover from recessions than other large economies. In particular, it lags significantly behind the United States in terms of labour market efficiency (although levels for individual euro area countries vary; see Chart 1 in Sondermann, D. (2018), “Towards more resilient economies: The role of well-functioning economic structures”, Journal of Policy Modeling, Vol. 40, No 1, pp. 97-117). Productivity growth has also generally been lower in the euro area than in the United States (see Chart 7 in Masuch, K. et al. (eds.) (2018), “Structural policies in the euro area”, Occasional Paper Series, No 210, ECB, June). These factors may limit the euro area’s relative capacity to bounce back from a recession. If the yield curve gets unanchored it becomes harder for the central bank to deliver inflation at target and minimise side effects on the economy. We have a medium-term orientation in pursuing price stability to account for the lags in the transmission of monetary policy to the economy and to inflation. The definition of medium term, however, is flexible because the appropriate monetary policy response to a deviation of inflation from the target depends on the origin, magnitude and persistence of the deviation.

These shocks have combined to create an inflationary shock of such magnitude and persistence that inflation risked becoming entrenched. These adverse developments coincided with a phase of highly accommodative monetary policy, following a long period of fighting too-low inflation and the risks to price stability associated with the pandemic shock. To avoid exacerbating inflationary pressures by stimulating demand and to prevent the de-anchoring of inflation expectations, we rapidly normalised our monetary policy stance. We increased rates by a total of 425 basis points in the space of just 12 months. In parallel, the end of net asset purchases and reinvestments under the asset purchase programme (APP), coupled with the repayment of our targeted longer-term refinancing operations, is making our balance sheet shrink considerably. With policy rates now firmly in restrictive territory, setting and communicating the direction of monetary policy has become more complex. Our monetary policy stance needs to be calibrated in a way that brings inflation back to target in a timely manner while avoiding unnecessary harm to economic activity. This is a fine line to walk, as the effects of monetary policy emerge with a lag. While our past decisions have already led to a material tightening in credit conditions and loan dynamics, their effects have yet to be felt in full across the real economy. At the same time, inflation remains elevated. Even if it is now falling as the effects of adverse supply shocks begin to fade and weaker growth eases price pressures, it will still take some time to reach levels compatible with price stability. In order to successfully complete the disinflation of the European economy, we need to flexibly adapt our policy to the evolving inflation outlook. In the current context where policy rates are around the level necessary to deliver medium-term price stability, I will argue that monetary policy may operate not just by increasing rates but also by keeping the prevailing level of policy rates for longer. In other words, persistence matters as much as level. This raises challenges for steering our policy stance. I will argue that our data-dependent approach, underpinned by our firm commitment to returning inflation to its target, is equipped to navigate these intricacies. The transmission of inflation through the economy Euro area inflation is largely due to a series of adverse supply shocks, notably the pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions and the energy shock triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.[1] In 2022, energy prices were the main driver of inflation (Chart 1).[2] The energy shock translated into broad-based price pressures given the impact of rising energy prices on all components of inflation. Chart 1 Contribution of components to euro area headline HICP inflation (annual percentage changes; percentage points contributions) Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations. Notes: HICP stands for Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices. NEIG stands for non-energy industrial goods. The latest observations are for June 2023. Headline inflation across euro area countries lacks a clear correlation with the strength of domestic demand (Chart 2). Chart 2 HICP in euro area countries vs. contribution of domestic demand to GDP growth (y-axis: HICP annual percentage changes; x-axis: average contribution of domestic demand (excluding inventories) to GDP growth quarter on quarter for the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 in percentage points) Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations. Notes: The observations for HICP are for June 2023. Observation for contribution of domestic demand to GDP growth in Croatia is missing. While supply shocks are now unwinding, their lagged effects on inflation are still being felt as past increases in input costs are passed on to consumers. The dynamics of food prices is a case in point. The energy shock and Russia’s war in Ukraine have contributed to a spike in food prices.[3] While the food producer price index peaked last October and food consumption has fallen in real terms in some euro area countries,[4] consumer food inflation has only recently started to moderate from elevated levels. Core inflation – that is, inflation excluding energy and food – provides another example of these lagged effects. Empirical analyses indicate that the contribution to core inflation of higher input costs stemming from supply chain disruptions and the energy shock only peaked last March (Chart 3). Furthermore, movements of producer prices influence retail prices with a delay of some months (Chart 4).[5] But there have also been other factors at play. The reopening of the economy after the pandemic provided a boost to consumption in the summer of last year, with a significant shift in demand towards services such as travel, hospitality and restaurants. These sectors faced labour shortages in a tight job market. Such sectoral demand-supply imbalances, coupled with the uncertainty generated by high and volatile inflation, have in turn allowed some firms to raise their profit margins.[6] This is consistent with the conspicuous increase in profits in specific sectors, on the back of retail prices rising quickly despite wholesale prices falling.[7] In this context, even though we were not facing generalised and sustained excess demand – or a significant reduction in production capacity[8] – we recalibrated our policy for three main reasons. The first was to avoid monetary policy adding to inflation risks. With inflation accelerating, failure to adjust policy rates would have made monetary policy more accommodative when the opposite was needed. The second was to anchor inflation expectations. Although inflation expectations did remain anchored, we needed to stem the risk of a de-anchoring in the face of persistently high inflation. De-anchoring inflation expectations would have made our disinflationary policy costlier, requiring higher policy rates to obtain the same real rate. It would also have increased the risk of a wage-price spiral, which would have been very costly to stop.[9] The third reason was to contain the risks connected to the strength of the labour market. With the unemployment rate at a historical low of 6.4% in June, firms tended to retain their workforce in response to slowing growth rather than resort to layoffs. This increased the risk that a phase of wage catch-up could turn into a self-sustained and destabilising process. Given that wages make up as much as 40% of input costs for service providers, and with services inflation accounting for almost two-thirds of core inflation,[10] we continue to closely monitor this risk. The shifting balance of risks These factors that were initially driving our actions have now diminished in intensity. First, the process of disinflation has been set in motion, pushing inflation expectations down. From March onwards, we have observed a consistent decline in consumer expectations for inflation over a 12-month horizon.[11] Likewise, firms’ expectations regarding their selling prices for the coming quarter have markedly decreased from their peak of last year (Chart 5).[12] Chart 5 Selling price expectations for the next three months in the EU (percentage balances) Sources: European Commission (including Eurostat) and ECB calculations. Notes: Percentage balances are the difference between positive and negative answer options, expressed as a percentage of total answers. The latest observations are for July 2023. Moreover, long-term inflation expectations derived from surveys have remained largely stable.[13] This allays concerns about a wage-price spiral. And so far wage developments have been in line with our staff projections, which envisage inflation reverting to 2% by the end of 2025. Second, as supply shocks recede, pipeline price pressures are diminishing, and the risks to inflation are becoming balanced. Supply chain pressures have substantially abated compared with last year. Commodity prices have fallen, although persistent upward pressures on energy and food prices due to geopolitical tensions and climatic events could reverse this trend (Charts 6 and 7). Falling energy prices have already pushed headline inflation lower: energy inflation, which had surged to 44.3% in March 2022, is now in negative territory (Chart 8). And most effects of the unwinding supply shocks on non-energy inflation are yet to emerge. Services inflation is still rising, owing to robust spending on holidays and travel as well as base effects. It is important to monitor this inflation component and its implications for the risks to overall inflation. Underlying inflation is moderating[14]. Inflation pressures at the early stages of the price formation process are easing, with producer price inflation (PPI) declining further in recent months (Chart 9). The proportion of items in the consumption basket that have a higher annual inflation rate compared with the previous quarter has fallen from a peak of 80% to less than 30% (Chart 10). Measures capturing the persistent and common component of inflation (PCCI) show increasing signs of softening (Chart 11). Although core inflation is still elevated and is projected to remain around current levels throughout the summer,[15] empirical evidence suggests that it is a lagging – not a leading – indicator of inflation.[16] In other words, looking at core inflation today does not tell us much about where headline inflation will settle in the medium term. Just as higher energy prices seeped through the economy on the way up, they will also eventually do so on the way down. Third, as the economic outlook deteriorates, the risks to economic activity are tilted to the downside. The “bullwhip effect” on inventories[17] seems to be reversing, contributing to a manufacturing recession. The downturn in the euro area manufacturing sector intensified in July, with the manufacturing PMI falling to its lowest level in over three years and prices charged by manufacturers falling at the steepest rate since 2009.[18] The services sector continued to expand, but it did so at its slowest rate since the start of 2023, suggesting that the resurgence in services spending may be losing momentum.[19] The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index shows a divergence between the euro area and the United States, with the euro area registering mostly negative surprises in recent months (Chart 12). Chart 12 Citigroup economic surprise indices (percent) Sources: Citigroup via Haver Analytics. Notes: The vertical line marks the date of the Governing Council meeting in June 2023. The latest observations are for 24 July 2023. Demand conditions in the euro area are likely to remain weak as the impact of monetary policy strengthens, governments unwind the fiscal policy measures they adopted in response to the energy crisis and the consumption impulse from excess savings fades. If downside risks to growth persist and materialise, high wage growth is less likely to be sustained. The decline in inflation could contain wage demands, and high profits may help to absorb them. And if firms start to anticipate a drop in future demand and labour needs, the economic strength represented by firms’ tendency to hoard labour could turn into a vulnerability. The path ahead for monetary policy So, what does this mean for how we calibrate monetary policy? The current juncture is particularly challenging, given that the effects of our past tightening are yet to be felt in full. We have clear indications that our monetary policy is being transmitted strongly to monetary and credit conditions. Money growth has fallen dramatically (Chart 13), and both nominal and real rates have increased considerably since the start of the tightening cycle. Chart 13 M1 and M3 growth in the euro area (annual percentage changes) Sources: ECB (Balance sheet items (BSI), Harmonised indices of consumer prices (ICP)) and ECB calculations. Notes: Real M3 and M1 are deflated by the HICP. The latest observations are for June 2023. In the credit market, both quantities and rates have reacted to our tightening much faster than in the past. Our bank lending survey finds that firms’ demand for loans in the second quarter of 2023 was at its lowest level since the survey was first launched two decades ago, while the tightening of lending standards since the start of the hiking cycle has been very substantial. These indications are consistent with the ongoing sharp deceleration of credit aggregates (Chart 14).[20] Rates for loans to firms and households are now at their highest levels since the end of 2008 and summer 2012, respectively. Moreover, the transmission of the rate hikes to time deposits – an important source of funding for banks – has been considerably stronger in the euro area than in the United States (Chart 15).[21] Chart 14 Credit growth in the euro area (three-month annualised percentage changes, seasonally adjusted) Sources: ECB (BSI).

The ECB policy rate is the main refinancing operations rate up to May 2014 and the deposit facility rate thereafter. The latest observations are for August 2023 for the policy rates and June 2023 for bank deposit rates. Given these developments, we must be prudent in calibrating our monetary policy stance if we are to reach our inflation target without harming economic activity unnecessarily. It is possible that the transmission of our monetary policy might be even stronger than the staff projections indicate. The rapid increase in interest rates and the fast contraction in our balance sheet may lead to stronger effects on monetary and credit conditions, and eventually on the economy and inflation. In addition, the tightening of monetary policy is being amplified by international policy spillovers.[22] In these circumstances, our disinflationary monetary policy may be conducted by combining different approaches. One approach – the level approach – entails going higher than where the policy rate is currently, with the risk of then having to cut earlier and faster, as implicit in investors’ expectations about the future interest rate path. Another approach – the persistence approach – instead advocates delivering the same degree of overall restriction while avoiding ups and downs, namely by keeping policy rates at the prevailing level for an extended period. Emphasising persistence may be particularly valuable in the current situation, where the policy rate is around the level necessary to deliver medium-term price stability, the risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations is low, inflation risks are balanced and economic activity is weak. Under such conditions, relying solely on an aggressive approach to rate hikes might amplify the risk associated with overtightening, which could subsequently require rates to be cut hastily in a deteriorating economic environment. The persistence element can mitigate this risk, giving the central bank more time to assess the lagged effects of its past policy measures and fine-tune the calibration of its stance as new information comes to light over time. This “breathing space” is crucial given that – as I said before – the transmission of our monetary policy may actually turn out to be stronger than our projections indicate. Moreover, favouring persistence would be in line with our previous proportionate response to the evolving challenges to price stability. We initially prioritised acting swiftly, hiking rates in large steps to normalise our monetary policy stance. We communicated a clear upward path for interest rates to signal commitment to this objective and we brought rates to restrictive levels to address the risks that inflation could remain too high for too long. Later, we reduced the speed, aware of the diminishing distance to our target and the increasing risk of policy misjudgements. However, emphasising persistence might pose communication challenges. It might give rise to concerns about the effectiveness of our disinflationary policy. Or it might prompt worries that persistence could simply amount to delaying tangible actions, such as rate hikes, in favour of a strategy of keeping rates higher at a later stage – which eventually may or may not be internalised by investors in their anticipation of future policy. Countering such misconceptions would require clear communication by the ECB. We need to explain that the same degree of restriction can be delivered with different combinations of rate levels and persistence. In any case, the level approach is not immune to communication problems. For example, under such an approach, a pattern of hiking followed by subsequent rate cuts could undermine the disinflationary impact of our policy if the yield curve inverts in anticipation.[23] But if market participants were to understand persistence as a key element of our policy, the risk of a yield curve inversion would fade. By determining the duration of a specific policy rate on the basis of incoming data, we can use persistence as a dynamic stabiliser. This would enable us to flexibly adapt our stance based on evolving risks without having to take decisions that might then need to be reversed, at a high cost. This adaptive methodology aligns seamlessly with our data-dependent approach. And of course, should the inflation outlook materially deteriorate, a further rate adjustment would be warranted. There are also financial stability aspects to consider, to the extent that they may affect the smooth transmission of our monetary policy. They would be ill-served by aggressive policies that could lead to atypical configurations of the term structure and interfere with usual asset and liability management practices, possibly exposing some intermediaries to substantial interest rate risks. Conclusion Let me conclude. Calibrating monetary policy has become increasingly complex. We are at a juncture where inflation is falling, with fading supply shocks, but past monetary tightening has yet to be felt in full. With rates now in restrictive territory, monetary policy needs to be calibrated in a way that allows us to reach our inflation target in a timely manner while avoiding unnecessary costs to the economy. So we need to get disinflation right. To this end, when steering the monetary policy stance, persistence is becoming as important as the level of our policy rates. This is particularly true given that risks to the inflation outlook have become more balanced, while risks to the economic outlook have shifted to the downside. A stance that incorporates persistence offers greater scope to flexibly adjust our policy in light of the incoming data, while crucially leaving no room to waver in the fight against inflation. And indeed, let there be no doubt: we are fully committed to bringing inflation back to our target in a timely way. De Santis, R.

(2023), “One year since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – the effects on euro area inflation”, The ECB Blog, 24 February. Before the war, Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 25% and 17% of total global exports of wheat and maize respectively, while Russia was a crucial provider of raw materials used in fertilizers, such as potash. In May 2023, euro area retail sales of food, drinks and tobacco were down 3.8% year on year in volume (and down 6.5% compared with January 2022). For example, in the food sector the maximum correlation between food producer prices and restaurant inflation – which has been a significant contributor to the rise in services inflation – is reached with a lag of five months. Restaurants have increased in weight in the services consumption basket, with their contribution to services inflation currently two to three times higher than their long-term average. Supply-demand mismatches limit competition and enable profit-maximising companies to increase their profit margins without losing market shares. High and volatile input price increases also facilitate widening of profit margins, as the extent to which increases in selling prices reflect the pass-through of increased costs or go beyond the cost increases and benefit profit margins is less clear in such environment.

See Table 1 in ECB (2023), “Consumer Expectations Survey - Inflation perceptions and expectations”, 5 July. European Commission (2023), “Economic Sentiment and Employment Expectations down in the EU and the euro area”, 28 July. The latest results from the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters and Survey of Monetary Analysts foresee long-run inflation at 2.1% and 2.0%, respectively. For the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters, longer-term inflation expectations relate to the year 2028, while for the Survey of Monetary Analysts long-run inflation expectations are not tied to a specific year. See ECB (2023), “ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters – Survey results Q3 2023” and ECB (2023), “The ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts: Aggregated Results”, July. The ECB monitors several indicators of underlying inflation. These can be broadly grouped into three categories: (i) exclusion-based measures, (ii) trimmed measures, and (iii) model-based measures. These measures aim to capture more persistent price developments (for instance, by excluding more volatile items from headline inflation) to provide a clearer signal for medium-term inflation developments. The persistence of core inflation over the summer months is due to high demand for services and base effects. Following the approach of Lenza and Reichlin (2011), ECB staff have conducted empirical analysis in which core inflation is compared with timely and smooth measures of underlying inflation. Centred and unilateral two-year moving averages (MA) of headline inflation are constructed and then compared with core inflation. The centred MA measure leads headline inflation, since it is by construction a linear combination of past and future observations. By contrast, the unilateral MA measure lags headline inflation, as it is solely based on past data. Euro area core inflation tracks the lagging indicator very closely. This result provides prima facie evidence that core inflation is not a timely indicator of medium-term inflation. Moreover, using current core inflation to forecast future headline inflation does not produce substantial gains compared to a simple autoregressive model, especially over short horizons. See also Lenza, M., and Reichlin, L. (2011), “Should the ECB use core inflation as a signal for medium-term inflation?”, VoxEU Column, 24 June. Firms reacted to the threat of shortages by ordering more and earlier than usual, which has in turn pushed up inflation along the pricing chain, a phenomenon known as the “bullwhip effect”. See Rees, D. and Rungcharoenkitkul, P. (2021), “Bottlenecks: causes and macroeconomic implications”, BIS Bulletin, No 48, 11 November. S&P Global (2023), “HCOB Flash Eurozone PMI”, 24 July. Ibid.

ECB staff analysis finds that a simultaneous monetary policy tightening across the United States, United Kingdom and the euro area doubles the negative impact on inflation in 2023 compared with a scenario without spillovers. We recently saw evidence of this in the results of the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA). Starting at end-2022, a systematic pattern emerged in the evolution of SMA respondents’ expectations across successive rounds whereby the continuous increase in the expected peak level of policy rates was accompanied by expectations of a shorter duration at peak (measured as the time length from peak to the first expected rate cut). According to the SMA of July 2023, the median expected timing of the next rate decrease is February 2024.

It stands in sharp contrast to the developments observed over the past decade when structural headwinds prevented inflation from converging towards our target. The timing of this conference on inflation drivers and dynamics could therefore hardly be more fitting. I will begin my remarks by briefly discussing how the current spike in inflation can in large part be attributed to temporary pandemic-related factors that are likely to dissipate in the medium term. Then I will turn to a more thorough discussion of the headwinds and tailwinds that may contribute to the evolution of inflation over the medium term, linking them to research that will be presented at this conference. My main focus will be on two important topics: inflation expectations and behavioural changes, for example regarding firms’ price setting behaviour. We devoted a substantial part of our recently concluded strategy review to understanding how these factors affect inflation dynamics, and continue to pursue an ambitious research agenda in these areas.[2] Opportunities such as this conference provide a welcome platform to interact with the academic community and thereby advance our thinking on these topics. The papers that will be presented at this conference address many questions that are highly relevant in the current debate on inflation and therefore have important ramifications for the future conduct of monetary policy. Near-term prospects: an inflation sneeze Let me begin by recalling the evolution of price dynamics in the euro area over the ten years that have passed since inflation last reached levels around 3%. Over most of the past decade, inflation has persistently fallen short of the ECB’s previous inflation aim of below, but close to, 2 percent. Both headline and core inflation averaged around 1% between January 2013 and December 2019 (Chart 1). Chart 1 Euro area headline and core HICP inflation (annual percentage changes) Source: Eurostat and ECB calculations. Latest observation: September 2021 (flash estimate). Moreover, inflation repeatedly surprised on the downside relative to our in-house staff projections before the pandemic (Chart 2). Other international institutions and financial market participants also continuously overpredicted future inflation developments. Chart 2 Eurosystem headline annual inflation projections over time (annual percentage changes) Source: ECB. Note: The chart is based on annual inflation data. Latest observation: August 2021, September 2021 Macroeconomic Projections. Subdued inflation dynamics were driven by both cyclical and structural factors, which, in combination, created sustained headwinds for underlying price pressures. A high level of slack after the double-dip recession, diminishing conventional monetary policy space in the vicinity of the effective lower bound as well as structural factors, such as globalisation, digitalisation and demographic change, have all contributed to persistently low inflation rates. During our monetary policy strategy review, we conducted detailed analysis to examine the relative importance of these drivers.[3] The pandemic has added a whirlwind of short-term disruptions on top of these long-term trends. Initially, the pandemic had put further downward pressure on inflation in the euro area. Inflation declined substantially in 2020, with rates temporarily entering negative territory in the second half of the year. Much of that decline was attributable to specific pandemic-related, temporary factors, including a substantial decline in commodity prices and the temporary cut in German VAT rates. With the onset of the recovery, inflation picked up rapidly. In fact, the current spike in inflation owes much to the continued impact of those same factors that pushed down inflation earlier in the annual comparison. Consequently, their impact on inflation rates will be transitory.[4] Indeed, more than half of measured headline inflation in the euro area, based on the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP), is currently due to rising energy prices and the reversal of the German VAT cut (Chart 3). Inflation has also been affected by changes in the weights in the consumption basket. Consumption patterns changed markedly last year owing to the impact of lockdowns, leading to a shift in consumption weights that are used to calculate Eurostat’s inflation index. These changing weights can have a notable impact on the measurement of inflation: HICP inflation would have been even higher in recent months using last year’s weights (Chart 3). For example, assuming constant consumption weights, euro area services inflation would have amounted to 2.1% in September instead of 1.7% indicated by the flash estimate. Due to the construction method of the HICP, the pandemic-induced expenditure shifts will continue to affect the index calculation until at least 2022.[5] Chart 3 Contributions to annual HICP inflation in the euro area (annual percentage changes; percentage point contributions) Source: Eurostat, Deutsche Bundesbank, September narrow inflation projection exercise (NIPE) and ECB calculations. Notes: Contributions from main HICP components exclude the impact of changes in HICP weights and the VAT rate cut in Germany. The impact of weight changes is estimated by the ECB. The contribution made by the temporary VAT cut in Germany is based on estimates provided in the Deutsche Bundesbank’s November 2020 Monthly Report. Latest observation: September 2021 (flash estimate). Two further pandemic-related factors are also having a temporary – if somewhat more durable – impact on inflation. First, continued supply chain disruptions, augmented by the global economic recovery, are pushing up producer prices due to supply and demand imbalances, thus feeding into non-energy industrial goods inflation, which has been exceptionally strong recently (Chart 4, left panel). Second, the re-opening of the economy has pushed up services inflation to 1.1% in August and 1.7% in September according to the flash estimate.[6] This recent surge in services inflation is predominantly due to rising price pressures in high-contact services (Chart 4, right panel). Chart 4 Non-energy goods and services inflation (annual percentage changes; percentage point contributions) Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations.Note: Series are shown with constant 2020 weights. Latest observations: August 2021. Speaking metaphorically, the current inflationary spike can be compared to a sneeze: the economy’s reaction to dust being kicked up in the wake of the pandemic and the ensuing recovery. And even though these pandemic-related developments are currently dominating media headlines, chances are high that the current episode of above-target inflationary pressures will subside over time. In our baseline projections, we assume that the supply bottlenecks as well as the impact of the re-opening will normalise over the course of 2022. The latest data and survey results, including findings on potential second-round effects in wage bargaining, do not suggest that price pressures will persist.[7] At present, headline inflation is forecast to fall back below our medium-term inflation target of 2% in the medium term (Chart 5). Similarly, core inflation is projected to rise only gradually. Chart 5 Eurosystem inflation projections (annual percentage changes) Source: ECB.Note: The chart is based on annual inflation data. Latest observation: August 2021, September 2021 Macroeconomic Projections. Medium-term outlook: feeling the breeze However, it would be premature to assert that current price dynamics will fully subside next year. The persistence of inflationary pressures ultimately depends on whether the dust kicked up by the pandemic continues to settle as the economic recovery takes hold. There are several sources of uncertainty that might entail more persistent inflationary pressures. As we form our assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook, we keep our finger in the wind to determine whether the breeze will turn out to be more long-lived than just a transitory gust. It is also possible that the pandemic has altered or reinforced structural trends, thus affecting inflation dynamics in the years to come. The remarkable increase in the pace of digitalisation and the mounting efforts to fight climate change are a case in point. Against the background of research contributions presented at this conference, I would like to highlight two additional, and possibly related, types of uncertainty that will determine whether current inflationary trends will turn out to be more persistent. First, the current uptick in inflation might result in a more enduring upward revision of expectations about nominal costs and inflation. And second, the pandemic may have triggered behavioural changes that alter rigidities at microeconomic level, such as wage and price stickiness, thus having an impact on the slope of the Phillips curve. The role of inflation expectations Let me begin with inflation expectations. The standard prescription for monetary policy is to “look through” temporary supply-side shocks and to only take policy action if inflation expectations and wage bargaining give rise to second-round effects posing a threat to price stability. The difficulty with this prescription is that aggregate inflation expectations are unobservable, requiring policymakers to employ various proxy measures. One method is to use market-based measures of inflation compensation. Immediately prior to the pandemic, estimates derived from market prices pointed to medium-term inflation expectations of only 1.1%, substantially below our medium-term inflation target (Chart 6, left panel). With the onset of the pandemic and the severe disruption to economic activity, these expectations declined to nearly 0.5% in March 2020. In that regard, the recent increase in market-based inflation expectations along the entire maturity distribution to levels closer to our target is a welcome development. It signals that investors have become more sanguine about the euro area inflation outlook without pointing – so far at least – to fears of more persistent inflation overshoots that could spiral back into actual price and wage dynamics. And since inflation expectations help to determine the real interest rate, higher inflation expectations reinforce the degree of policy accommodation in an environment of low nominal yields, and thus contribute to lifting inflation towards our new symmetric medium-term target of 2%.

Risk-neutral probabilities may differ significantly from physical, or true, probabilities. Another method of gauging inflation expectations is to rely on survey-based metrics. For the euro area, these expectation proxies are derived from surveys of professional forecasters, households and businesses.[8] Similar to market-based measures, survey-based measures of inflation expectations have exhibited a notable uplift in the wake of the recovery from the pandemic but remain below our target (Chart 6, left panel). In other words, there is currently no indication that elevated inflation rates are becoming entrenched in medium and longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area, entailing risks for price stability. On the contrary, recent developments across indicators suggest that investors and professional forecasters are increasingly internalising our new monetary policy strategy as well as our recently revised forward guidance, bringing us closer to our inflation target of 2 percent. In short, we will only start raising our key policy rates once we are confident that inflation has durably converged to our target well ahead of the end of our projection horizon, and we judge that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term. In an environment of measurable movements in inflation expectations, insights regarding their role in monetary policy transmission remain crucial for the policy deliberations of central banks. In the post-pandemic context, it is particularly challenging to discern whether changes in measures of expectations indicate a more fundamental change that may durably impact the transmission of monetary policy. So what can research tell us? Recent research in this area – including several papers presented at this conference – has helped shed light on how different types of inflation expectations are formed, how reliable the various measures are, and what these findings may imply for the conduct of monetary policy. How reliable are surveys of professional forecasters, for example? One of the conference papers identifies an intriguing mechanism whereby even rational forecasters might report a biased measure of their true expectations, with individual forecasts over-reacting to private information, while under-reacting to publicly available information.[9] Moreover, aggregating inflation expectations as a point estimate can be misleading because it disregards the distribution of inflation expectations. For instance, probability distributions of inflation expectations derived from option prices show a clear shift in recent months. Following a long period of market-based distributions of inflation expectations being persistently skewed to the downside, the probability of option-implied inflation rates above 2.0% over the next five years has recently reached its highest level since 2012 at 40%(Chart 6, right panel). Such distributions are likely to matter even more in the case of households and businesses who often lack accurate knowledge of the official inflation rate or even the central bank’s inflation target, resulting in a wide distribution of inflation expectations. Indeed, new survey evidence in one of the conference papers confirms that inflation expectations of US firms are far from anchored.[10] For central banks, these findings highlight the importance of communicating our monetary policy objectives effectively – an important consideration in our strategy review and in our decision to adopt a symmetric inflation target of 2% over the medium term.[11] Another conference paper addresses this issue by presenting empirical evidence corroborating the hypothesis that central bank communication focusing on the goals of monetary policy actions is more effective than communication focusing on individual monetary policy instruments.[12] Behavioural changes due to the pandemic The second source of uncertainty I would like to discuss today relates to potential behavioural changes induced by the pandemic. Microeconomic rigidities such as those stemming from wage- and price-setting behaviour have profound implications for the transmission of monetary policy. Collectively, these rigidities play a crucial but subtle role in determining the location and slope of the Phillips curve – a reduced form description of how changes in aggregate demand put pressure on inflation. This relationship can arise from underlying structural relations in a wide class of state-of-the-art sticky price models, as one paper at this conference will show.[13] Model simulations and recent empirical evidence indicate that the slope of the Phillips curve may have flattened considerably over recent decades, a finding that continues to generate substantial debate in academia and policy circles (Chart 7). Chart 7 Change in the slope of the Phillips curve (x-axis: log percentage points, y-axis: percentage points) Source: Costain, J., Nakov, A. and Petit, B. (2021), “Flattening of the Phillips Curve with State-Dependent Prices and Wages”, The Economic Journal, July. Note: The top panels show scatterplots of the change in inflation and the output gap in US data over the periods 1980-2000 and 2000-2020, respectively. The bottom panels illustrate simulated data generated by a model of state-dependent price and wage setting (Costain et al., 2021) for the same time periods. The analysis indicates that the model explains roughly half of the observed flattening of the Phillips curve. According to the model, lower inflation in the second period (2000-2020) has reduced the frequency of price changes, implying a reduced transmission of demand shocks to the aggregate price level. Such a change would have significant implications for the conduct of monetary policy. When inflation is below target, a flatter structural Phillips curve may imply that a greater degree of policy accommodation is required to return to target. In turn, a flatter Phillips curve implies that more forceful monetary policy tightening may be necessary to lower inflation that surpasses the central bank’s target. However, like inflation expectations, the slope of the Phillips curve is not directly observable, and estimates differ depending on the models they are derived from. Research presented at this conference suggests that one has to be careful in the estimation of the Phillips curve relationship in order to avoid confusing a changing slope with a shift in inflation expectations.[14] A further key structural determinant of the slope of the Phillips curve is the rate at which firms reset prices, affecting the responsiveness of the price level to changes in economic activity. Some have argued that the low rates of inflation witnessed over the past decade have reduced the rate of price resets, since firms are less likely to find themselves significantly away from their optimal price.[15] However, research conducted by the ECB and the PRISMA network on micro-level price data challenges this claim, finding no noticeable slowdown in the rate of price resets (Chart 8). Work in progress in the Eurosystem shows that the rate of price changes may even have increased during the pandemic. Chart 8 Frequency of price changes: a comparison of IPN (data: 1996-2001) and PRISMA (data: 2011-2017) results (percentages) Source: Gautier et al. (2021), “New Facts on Consumer Price Rigidity in the Euro Area”, Working Paper Series, ECB (forthcoming).Note: The chart shows the frequency of price changes documented by the Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network (IPN) and the Price-Setting Microdata Analysis (PRISMA) network for a set of 50 product categories covered by both studies. From 2003, the IPN conducted an in-depth study of inflation persistence and price rigidity in the euro area by analysing a broad set of macro and micro data covering the period from 1996 until 2001. The IPN has concluded its work. The PRISMA network was set up in 2018 to deepen the understanding of price-setting behaviour and inflation dynamics in the EU by collecting and studying various types of microdata, including data underlying official price indices such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI), scanner data and online prices, covering the period from 2011 until 2017. The frequency of price changes displayed in the chart is measured as the fraction of all prices for each of the 50 product categories in the sample that change on a monthly basis. This research is representative of a wider shift in the literature, which increasingly investigates the macroeconomic impact of heterogenous firm-level decisions. The impact of such firm-level decisions on macroeconomic outcomes has crucial implications for the transmission of monetary policy decisions to the real economy. There is growing evidence that the aggregate change in the price level is not only determined by the average rate of price resets, but rather by the entire distribution of price adjustments. For example, a large number of relatively small changes (in absolute value) may imply relatively high stickiness in the aggregate price level. By contrast, if firms that are furthest away from their optimum price are more likely to adjust their prices – known in the literature as selection effects – the price level may be more flexible. One conference paper that has been written under the PRISMA network finds evidence that the probability of price changes indeed depends on the extent of mispricing both for the United States and the euro area, as indicated by the V-shape in Chart 9. The x-axis shows how far a firm’s current price is from its optimal reset price, which proxies the gain from changing the price. The y-axis shows the probability of changing the price. Firms further away from the optimal reset price are indeed more likely to change prices. However, the paper also shows that the probability of adjustment in response to monetary and credit shocks does not depend on the extent of mispricing. Hence, the paper finds little evidence that selection contributes significantly to the overall inflation response to an aggregate shock.[16] Thus, while some degree of state-dependence is present in the micro data, it appears that its effect is muted in the aggregate, rejecting the results of state-dependent models with high selection[17] and favouring models of the “rational-inattention” type with a low degree of selection.[18] Chart 9 Evidence of state-dependence: repricing probability as a function of the price gap (percentage) Source: Karadi, P., Schoenle, R. and Wursten, J. (2021), “Measuring Price Selection in Microdata: It’s Not There”, Working Paper Series, No 2566, ECB.Note: The figure shows the probability of a price change as a function of mispricing in the euro area and the United States. The V-shape of the curve is consistent with state-dependent price setting: the probability of adjustment steadily increases with the extent of mispricing. The extent of mispricing is proxied as a distance from the average price of the same product among those competitors that reset their prices in the same month. The measure also controls for the persistent heterogeneity among products and stores by eliminating the impact of product-store fixed effects. Additional details on the methodology are available in ECB Working Paper No 2566. From a policymaker’s perspective, it is encouraging to witness the efforts to translate the impact of micro-level distributions into macroeconomic representations of policy transmission, for example through the creation of informative statistics based on micro-level data, as done in one of the conference papers.[19] These findings generate constructive input for our policy discussions on the transmission of monetary policy and, ultimately, help us to improve our knowledge regarding the underlying drivers of inflation dynamics in the euro area.[20] Conclusion Let me conclude. Current inflationary pressures in the euro area are driven by pandemic-related factors that can be expected to largely fade out over the course of next year. Overreacting to such short-term volatility would be harmful and risk jeopardising the ongoing economic recovery, which is why the ECB’s monetary policy remains focused on fulfilling its medium-term price stability mandate. Nonetheless, significant uncertainty remains as to how persistent some of the current price pressures will prove to be. The ECB therefore continues to carefully monitor inflationary developments in the euro area, with a particular focus on second-round effects, to determine whether the headwinds that have exerted downward pressure on inflation for much of the past decade are still present, or whether they may reverse in the aftermath of the pandemic. The cyclical and specific pandemic factors will increasingly be overlaid by structural changes, which can go in different directions.[21] Structural factors such as globalisation, the fight against climate change, demographic trends and digitalisation are likely to continue to affect prices and price-setting, and hence the transmission of our policy, but the direction is still unclear.[22] High-quality academic research into the underlying drivers of inflation dynamics hence remains a vital input for our monetary policy deliberations. I therefore look forward to hearing more about the insightful papers and novel research findings that will be presented at this conference. Thank you.

We have embarked on the fastest tightening cycle in our history, raising our key policy rate – the deposit facility rate – from -0.5% to 3.5%, and started reducing the size of our balance sheet. Our actions are being swiftly transmitted to borrowing conditions, slowing the pace of credit creation. Inflation has started to come down from its historically high level, largely reflecting the sharp drop in energy prices. Underlying inflation has also moderated recently, but it has proven more persistent than expected. Despite the welcome turn in inflationary developments, the path towards sustained price stability remains uncertain and fraught with risks. In my remarks today, I will reflect on the outlook for inflation in the euro area. I will first explain the factors that are expected to drive the continued decline in headline inflation under the latest Eurosystem staff projections. I will then describe some risks around the baseline scenario and discuss what these imply for the optimal conduct of monetary policy. Profit margins expected to absorb rising labour costs In the June 2023 Eurosystem staff projections, headline inflation is expected to decline notably over the coming months and to gradually converge to levels somewhat above 2% in 2025 (Slide 2, left-hand side).[1] The projected decline in headline inflation rests, to a significant extent, on a further decline in energy inflation and a marked drop in food inflation, both driven by large base effects (Slide 2, right-hand side). Core inflation is projected to moderate more gradually, from an average of 5.1% this year to 2.3% in 2025, as pipeline pressures recede and the tightening of monetary policy increasingly weighs on economic activity.[2] Over the near term, disinflation is hence primarily driven by a reversal of the supply-side shocks that had caused the unprecedented surge in inflation (Slide 3, left-hand side). Surveys show that bottlenecks in the global manufacturing sector have by now fully unwound and that input prices have fallen to the lowest level in many years as gas and oil prices have continued their sharp descent. Softening demand, as reflected in a decline in new orders, should further support the disinflationary impulse in the manufacturing sector, which is particularly sensitive to higher interest rates. As the energy shock unwinds and supply chains normalise, domestic demand, and wage growth in particular, has become the dominant factor driving recent inflation developments, and is expected to remain so over the projection horizon (Slide 3, right-hand side). Demand-side shocks tend to be more persistent, especially in the euro area’s institutional environment built on centralised collective bargaining, with wage agreements having an average duration of around two years.[3] Price pressures in the services sector, where labour costs represent a larger share of total costs, are therefore expected to fade more gradually. The catch-up in wages is assumed to moderate on the back of falling headline inflation, while current high nominal wage growth is expected to be absorbed, to a large extent, by firms’ profit margins, thus breaking the vicious circle between wages and prices.[4] Firms’ selling price expectations, which have been correlating closely with consumer price inflation over the past two years, corroborate the assumptions underlying the projections (Slide 4, left-hand side). In the manufacturing sector, the share of firms expecting to raise prices further has fallen back to pre-pandemic levels. In the services sector, the share remains higher but has also been coming down for four consecutive months. Risks to the inflation outlook tilted to the upside The baseline scenario of the Eurosystem staff projections is a plausible representation of how inflation could evolve in the absence of further shocks. That said, the outlook for inflation remains highly uncertain. On the downside, banks may tighten credit standards by more than currently envisaged because of risks to the value of their assets, their exposure to interest rate risk and tighter funding conditions.[5] A re-emergence of financial tensions constitutes another downside risk. Together, such effects could accelerate disinflation in the euro area. On the upside, risks are broader. Option prices in financial markets suggest that risks to the medium-term inflation outlook remain tilted to the upside (Slide 4, right-hand side). Three types of upside risks can be distinguished. Risks of negative supply-side shocks One is that negative supply-side shocks could continue to hit the euro area and global economy. These risks are particularly pertinent for fossil fuels, like gas and oil, due to the green transition and the war in Ukraine.[6] There are also other shocks, however, that we know exist but that are difficult to integrate into the baseline, so-called “known unknowns”. El Niño is a case in point. The US Climate Prediction Center has recently declared that El Niño conditions are now officially present and are expected to gradually strengthen in the northern hemisphere in the winter of 2023/24.[7] ECB analysis suggests that a one-degree temperature increase during El Niño historically raised global food prices by more than 6% after one year (Slide 5, left-hand side). El Niño also reinforces the risks of extreme weather events stemming from global warming. Sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic are currently significantly above their average over the past 40 years (Slide 5, right-hand side). The war in Ukraine, in particular the heightened uncertainty about the Black Sea grain deal and the flooding caused by the destruction of the dam in the Kherson region, poses further upside risks to food inflation. New research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis suggests that food price inflation matters. Among consumer price index components, it was found to be the one with the highest signal-to-noise ratio and hence predictive power for future headline inflation, more than any core inflation component.[8] Long-lasting damage to the euro area’s supply capacity The second type of upside risk relates to hysteresis effects. Shocks, even if transitory, can have persistent effects on economic activity.[9] The global financial crisis of 2008, for example, inflicted sustained income losses on millions of workers who remained excluded from labour markets for many years.[10] Similarly, the pandemic and the energy price shock after the Russian invasion of Ukraine may cause long-lasting damage to the euro area’s supply capacity. We are seeing two concerning developments. One is that average hours worked per employee remain below pre-pandemic levels (Slide 6, left-hand side).[11] As a result, despite the strong increase in employment by 3.1%, total hours worked increased by only 1.4% over the same period.[12] One reason behind the sluggish recovery in average hours worked is the marked increase in sick leaves.[13] In Germany, for example, around 8.5% of all employees insured in the public health system were recorded as being on sick leave at the peak last winter (Slide 6, right-hand side).[14] Insurance funds data suggest that more than 60% of the increase in sick leaves is related to respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.[15] The second concern is that a notable gap has emerged between actual investment and the investment levels that could have been expected if the economy had evolved along its pre-pandemic growth path (Slide 7, left-hand side). This shortfall significantly predates the tightening of monetary policy. Supply chain disruptions affecting critical capital goods, such as semiconductor chips, have been one reason why capital accumulation has slowed. As delivery times normalise, these effects should reverse, supported by investments related to the green transition, digitalisation and reshoring of parts of global supply chains. Other factors may prove more persistent, however. Most notably, uncertainty in the wake of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine remains significant. The automotive sector is a case in point. The number of car registrations remains well below pre-pandemic figures, as price level effects and legislative efforts to accelerate the green transition have made many consumers reluctant to purchase new vehicles (Slide 7, right-hand side).[16] Instead, they hold on to their old cars for longer, with the average age of passenger cars having risen to 12 years, from 7 to 8 years not so long ago. In other words, even as past shocks abate, their broader repercussions may have persistent effects on the future productive capacity of the economy. Indeed, potential output estimates for the euro area have been measurably revised down relative to the pre-pandemic trend.[17] New research shows that such hysteresis effects may amplify and prolong the rise in inflation caused by transitory supply shocks.[18] The reason is that the fall in investment and the rise in employment required to restore total hours worked tends to weigh on productivity and thereby raise firms’ marginal costs.[19] This channel is economically relevant. Labour productivity growth, both per employee and per hour, contracted in the first quarter of this year, putting upward pressure on unit labour costs, which is the relevant cost measure for firms (Slide 8). In the Eurosystem staff projections, these effects are expected to reverse, as labour productivity growth is forecast to rebound strongly in 2024 and 2025. The implied fall in unit labour costs, in turn, is expected to allow firms to absorb the increase in nominal wages in their profit margins. Should weak productivity growth persist, however, the further increase in unit labour costs raises the probability that firms will pass on parts of the increase in their costs to final consumer prices, setting in motion a perilous wage-price spiral. Weaker slowdown in aggregate demand This brings me to the third type of upside risks: aggregate demand may be slowing by less than currently anticipated, implying that fiscal and monetary policy are not sufficiently restrictive. Fiscal policy is expected to tighten over the projection horizon. However, only about half of the discretionary stimulus provided in response to the pandemic and the energy shock is expected to be reversed by 2025. Such discretionary measures are leaving fiscal policy accommodative and are not sufficiently offset by efforts to increase public investments that could help reduce medium-term inflationary pressures. In this case, monetary policy must become more restrictive.[20] Quantifying the level of interest rates necessary to bring inflation back to target in a timely manner is inherently difficult, however, as there is large uncertainty about the effects of monetary policy. First, within each model there is a large range of plausible outcomes (known as parameter uncertainty). For example, according to a benchmark model from the academic literature, a one percentage point increase in the short-term interest rate could dampen inflation after one year by as little as 0.1 percentage point, or by as much as 0.8 percentage points (Slide 9, left-hand side).[21] The second source of uncertainty relates to model uncertainty – that is, even the median estimate, which itself is surrounded by large parameter uncertainty, usually differs considerably across different classes of economic models.[22] For example, the estimated impact on inflation in 2025 of the ECB’s policy actions taken since December 2021 ranges from 0.9 to 3.9 percentage points across three of the ECB’s main macroeconomic models (Slide 9, right-hand side). Expectations are critical for monetary policy transmission These differences reflect, to a considerable degree, the role that expectations are assumed to play in consumption and investment decisions. Put simply, the more households and firms believe that the past is a good guide for the future, the less powerful monetary policy will be. Inflation expectations are a case in point. If they are adaptive, meaning they change in response to actual inflation outcomes, inflation will become more persistent, and monetary policy will transmit more slowly. Carefully analysing how inflation expectations evolve is therefore critical for understanding the strength and speed of policy transmission. At present, the long period of above-target inflation raises concerns about a potential shift in inflation expectations. The experience over the past ten years suggests that market-based measures of long-term inflation compensation are not always firmly anchored around our 2% target (Slide 10, left-hand side). Before the pandemic, they declined significantly as inflation fell short of our target. About a year ago, they gradually began to move beyond 2%, to currently stand around 2.5%.[23] Expectations of inflation settling above our 2% target could be an early sign that investor start questioning central banks’ determination to restore price stability. In a recent survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, for example, nearly two-thirds of respondents said that global central banks would accept inflation of 2% to 3% if it helped to avoid a recession, suggesting risks to central banks’ credibility (Slide 10, right-hand side). Nearly a fifth said central banks would accept even higher inflation of 3% to 4%. For euro area firms, evidence on inflation expectations remains scant. A regular survey among Italian firms conducted by Banca d’Italia suggests that Italian firms generally expect inflation to decline from current high levels, but to be highly persistent and to remain above 5% in 2025 (Slide 11).[24] Previous rounds of the same survey suggest that expectations of high inflation are not a systematic feature: in 2019, Italian firms expected inflation to settle below 1% two years ahead.[25] That is, firms’ expectations seem to adapt to periods of both low and high inflation, just as those of investors in financial markets. Inflation expectations of consumers are more readily available from surveys run by various institutions. One main insight from those surveys is that many consumers are inattentive. For example, in the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey, a significant share of respondents expects prices to always remain unchanged, both over the short and medium term (Slide 12). That said, consumer surveys also signal shifts in expectations. Today, for example, less households expect inflation to be at, or close to, 2% over the medium term than on average over the past three years (Slide 12, right-hand side). Yet, there can be large discrepancies across surveys. In the ECB’s survey, reported inflation expectations for German households three years ahead are currently 2%, while they are 5% in the survey conducted by the Deutsche Bundesbank (Slide 13, left-hand side). Differences of that size complicate the assessment as to whether expectations are anchored or not. Qualitative data, as collected by the European Commission, are therefore a useful complement for understanding consumers’ inflation perceptions and expectations.[26] In the past, inflation perceptions tended to closely follow actual inflation trends (Slide 13, right-hand side). Recently, however, an unusual gap has emerged between inflation perceptions and actual inflation.[27] It seems that the recent sharp decline in headline inflation has not yet affected consumers’ perceptions, as they continue to experience inflation as historically high. The observed shift in inflation expectations can hence reduce the strength of policy transmission. Structural factors may dampen effects of monetary policy Structural factors can further dampen the effects of monetary policy, three of which seem quantitatively most relevant. The first is the rising share of services in economic activity and employment.[28] While the services sector accounted for around half of gross value added during the tightening cycle of the 1970s, it accounts for more than 70% today. Similarly, three jobs out of four are in the services sector. The shift towards services is likely to affect monetary policy transmission.[29] Because services are less capital-intensive and their prices are, on average, more rigid than in other sectors, changes in interest rates are slower to affect aggregate inflation outcomes.[30] The second factor relates to the impact of monetary policy on households’ cash flows. The marked increase in the share of household loans with a fixed interest rate currently shields many net borrowers from higher interest rates. At the same time, banks are slow to pass through interest rate increases to deposit rates. As a result, the aggregate impact of the increase in policy interest rates on household’s net interest income has been fairly limited so far (Slide 14, left-hand side). At the end of last year, the average euro area household has received about €10 less per year in net interest rate income compared with a year earlier. Moreover, interest rate payments as a share of gross disposable income are still a fraction of what they were ten or 15 years ago (Slide 14, right-hand side). The third factor relates to the labour market. One of the greatest social benefits of the fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine is its impact on the labour market. Employment in the euro area has never been higher, and unemployment never been lower. Yet, labour demand remains exceptionally strong. The ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers remains close to its historical high (Slide 15, left-hand side). Surveys point to continued employment growth in the coming months. Put differently, one of the key channels in policy transmission – if not the most important one – is currently not working as usual.[31] Structural factors, such as the rise in sick leave, the higher share of services in value added and a shortage of workers, are contributing to this. But demand is playing a key role, too. In the services sector, for example, the share of firms reporting demand as a factor limiting business remains close to historical lows. A tight labour market, in turn, increases the bargaining power of workers in an environment in which wages are already expanding at a historically high pace. If wages increased by more than currently projected, paired with potentially lower productivity, firms would be more likely to pass on higher labour costs to consumer prices. This risk is corroborated by evidence that, as inflation increases, prices and wages become less sticky – that is, they are adjusted more frequently, as the cost of keeping them unchanged increases (Slide 15, right-hand side).[32] In such an environment, whether a wage-price spiral will unfold will ultimately depend on the ability and willingness of firms to absorb higher unit labour costs in their profit margins. This, in turn, depends on the economic environment in which firms operate, and hence on monetary policy. Recent work by Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard has examined the role of labour market tightness for the United States.[33] Their work suggests that unless the ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers falls back below its pre-COVID level, inflation is unlikely to return to target in the next three years. Policy implications and conclusions All in all, the risks to the inflation outlook are tilted to the upside, reflecting both supply- and demand-side factors. The question is how monetary policy should take such risks into account. The IMF has recently issued a clear recommendation: if inflation persistence is uncertain, risk management considerations speak in favour of a tighter monetary policy stance.[34] There are two reasons for this. First, the costs of protecting the economy from upside risks to inflation are comparatively small, as the policy rate can be brought back to neutral levels faster than if policymakers acted under the assumption of low inflation persistence (Slide 16, left-hand side). Second, it is very costly to react only after upside risks to inflation have materialised, as this could destabilise inflation expectations and thus require a sharper contraction in output to restore price stability (Slide 16, right-hand side). A monetary policy stance that errs on the side of determination “insures” against costly policy mistakes caused by inflation being more persistent than expected. Such an approach is called “robust”.[35] Simple Taylor-type policy rules offer another angle to illustrate the monetary policy implications of underestimating inflation persistence. These rules have well-known limitations, so that their predicted interest rate levels should not be taken at face value. Nevertheless, they yield useful insights about the directional bias of policy when facing inflation uncertainty. These rules suggest that the optimal interest rate path would have been steeper, and outside the range of paths prescribed by a variety of rules at the time, had we been able to correctly anticipate the future path of inflation in June 2022 (Slide 17, left-hand side). This also has implications for policy today, as inflation forecast errors correlate strongly over time, as shown by a recent analysis by the Bank for International Settlements (Slide 17, right-hand side).[36] In other words, the fact that we underestimated inflation persistence last year raises the probability that we are also underestimating inflation today.[37] These findings confirm new research showing that a narrow reliance on projections can lead to large policy mistakes, and that, as a result, giving more weight to observable data, in particular at times of high uncertainty, can improve the quality of policy decisions.[38] Taken together, this means that we need to remain highly data-dependent and err on the side of doing too much rather than too little. Risks of both a de-anchoring of inflation expectations and weaker monetary policy transmission suggest that there is a limit to how long inflation can stay above our 2% target. We thus need to keep raising interest rates until we see convincing evidence that developments in underlying inflation are consistent with a return of headline inflation to our 2% medium-term target in a sustained and timely manner.

Labour hoarding may also have contributed to lower average hours worked. Recorded as being on sick leave on the first day of the month. According to working time accounts of the German Institute of Employment Research, working hours lost per employee therefore increased to 91 hours in 2022 compared with 68 hours in 2021, an increase of around a third. Available evidence from other larger euro area countries is more limited, but also points to increases in sick leaves in 2022. In Italy, the total number of sick leave days increased in 2022 by 34% compared with the previous year. In France, the number of employees with at least one day of sick leave is reported to have increased by about 11% in 2022 compared with 2021. Information for sick leaves in Spain point to an increase of average monthly sick leave per employee by 30% in 2022 compared with 2021.

The analysis also highlights the important role of fiscal policy in ensuring price stability in the face of adverse supply-side shocks. This effect may be compounded by the absence of “creative destruction” during the crisis and increased spending on making supply chains more robust rather than more efficient. The International Monetary Fund calculated that additional fiscal consolidation of 2.5 percentage points of GDP until 2025 would reduce the policy rate required to restore price stability by 30 to 50 basis points.

While these developments have been dominated by changes in the inflation risk premium, there have also been notable shifts in genuine inflation expectations. Moreover, changes in risk premia are not irrelevant for monetary policy as they may signal an impending shift in the belief of investors. See Banca d’Italia (2023), Economic Bulletin, April. Current high levels could be related to extrapolative behaviour of firms, confirming the relevance of adaptive expectations; see Visco, I.

Since the Banque de France started conducting a quarterly survey among firms in 2022, the respondent firms have been expecting inflation three to five years ahead to be 3%. A survey in France finds that while firms’ inflation expectations show a positive bias, it is significantly smaller than that shown by households. See Savignac, F. et al.

After a long period when inflation in the euro area was too low, it is now far too high. We are in the tenth consecutive month of record-high inflation rates and we may see this streak continue in the near term. Inflation is being caused by a series of unprecedented shocks, which have led to turning points in the global economy. As a result, price pressures have proven much stronger and more persistent than originally projected. In this setting, monetary policymakers must ensure that inflation does not become entrenched and that it returns to target in the medium term. And our policy response will need to account for the special combination of shocks that we are facing in the euro area. In my remarks this evening, I would like to address two issues. First, the nature of the inflation shock we are facing in the euro area today, and second, the implications this has for monetary policy now and in the future. The shocks hitting the euro area economy In our monetary policy strategy, the appropriate response to a deviation of inflation from our target depends on three factors: the source, size and persistence of that deviation. Typically, when the source of an inflationary shock is stemming mainly from demand, monetary policy will respond proactively to prevent the economy from overheating. And when faced with supply shocks, to the extent that such shocks are seen to have no lasting impact on inflation, central banks will “look through” and extend the medium-term policy horizon if necessary. But such a neat categorisation does not adequately capture the situation we are facing in the euro area today. We are not seeing the type of demand-led overheating that is visible in the United States and, despite a tight labour market, the risk of a wage-price spiral so far seems to remain contained. Instead, the euro area is seeing an increase in inflation driven by two unprecedented shocks. These shocks have constrained global supply, but they have also shifted demand and led to a large and persistent inflation response. The first shock was the pandemic. Pandemic-related supply bottlenecks and rising prices have reinforced each other, with firms reacting to the threat of shortages by ordering more and earlier. This “bullwhip effect”[1] has driven up prices along the pricing chain. At the same time, the fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic has succeeded in protecting nominal incomes, thereby supporting a fast recovery of demand when our economies reopened. The resilience of incomes has, in turn, triggered large swings in demand across sectors. During the lockdown period, and thanks notably to e-commerce, consumption was concentrated on durable goods. Then, when the economy reopened, we saw strong pent-up demand for services. Since the start of the pandemic, the volatility of durable goods consumption has been almost ten times higher than during the preceding two decades, and almost 30 times higher for services. This has led to inflation broadening into both industrial goods and services. Today, around three-quarters of the items in the core inflation basket have inflation rates above 2%. The second shock has been Russia’s unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine. Even before the invasion, OPEC+ production cuts and capital constraints on US shale producers were restricting energy supply. This resulted in a spike in energy prices which was a major factor in our underestimation of inflation .[2] But the invasion has hugely aggravated the supply squeeze and sent energy prices to extraordinary levels, making it all the more challenging to forecast inflation. European gas and electricity prices are up 105% and 75%, respectively, since the months before the invasion[3], and around 650% and 450%, respectively, since the first half of 2021. This surge in energy prices has directly contributed around 30% to the headline inflation rate since the start of this year and, indirectly, has added to the broadening of price pressures across the economy. In fact, the models used by the national central banks indicate that the indirect effects of higher energy costs are currently contributing around one-third to core inflation. The persistence of inflation Collectively, these shocks have pushed inflation a long way from our target. Headline inflation – which was negative as recently as December 2020 – has risen by 9.4 percentage points from its trough during the pandemic to its peak last month. Core inflation has risen by 4.1 percentage points. In the recent past, elastic global supply has meant that shocks to production or energy have dissipated eventually. Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in the 1990s, for example, oil prices fell below their pre-war level after around five months. And following the Japanese earthquake and nuclear disaster in 2011, production is estimated to have returned to normal after only seven months for Japanese firms.[4] But the shocks triggered by the pandemic and the war have also created what I have previously called a “new global map” of economic relationships.[5] The economic turning points on this new global map imply that supply constraints are likely to last longer than in the past. And this means, in turn, that it is taking longer for the inflationary effects of those shocks to fade out. Two issues are worth considering here. First, geopolitics have shaken up European energy markets. The cut in gas supplies owing to the Russian invasion has become a major structural change which will have ramifications for several years. For example, following the two oil shocks of the 1970s – the OPEC embargo and the Iranian revolution – the effect on oil prices was still persistent after three years. This was because, in both cases, the shocks were related to a lasting shift in the geopolitical landscape, and reductions in oil supply could not be fully offset by oil from other sources.[6] Today, although the EU response will cushion the rise in energy costs, fossil fuel prices are likely to be higher for some time. Fully replacing European imports of Russian fossil fuels is a challenge in the short term, even though there are an increasing number of examples of substitution effects taking place.[7] Over the longer term, the war is likely to accelerate the green transition in Europe, including the switch to renewables. This will require considerable green investment but will also weigh on investment in oil and gas production during the transition phase. That could put upward pressure on fossil fuel prices while demand for those fuels remains high. If energy prices are durably higher during the transition, it may have an impact on industrial production in Europe, affecting both supply and prices. This is certainly how firms in the euro area see the situation. In a recent ECB survey, at least 80% of respondents expected the ongoing transition to make the raw materials and energy they use more expensive, leading to higher prices for their products.[8] Second, globalisation is and will be changing. The disruptions created by the pandemic, the exposure of vulnerabilities, the new geopolitical landscape and the prospect of higher energy and transport costs look set to trigger a reassessment of global value chains. While I doubt that we will see de-globalisation, firms are likely to hold higher inventories on a permanent basis and shorten their supply chains to relocate high-value services and R&D centres. This is especially true where strategic considerations come into play. We might also see energy-intensive production being relocated owing to the uneven impact of the current energy price shock. Added to this, the speed of the transition and the new energy mix will contribute to material transformations. A recent survey finds that around 60% of firms had increased their inventories of critical products by the end of 2021, and almost 90% were expecting to regionalise their production over the next three years.[9] This is likely to reduce efficiency and increase costs, which could create inflation pressures while supply chains are adjusting. It could also make the economic cycle more volatile.[10] Over time, however, the turning points I have identified could also dampen the impact on prices. The green transition, for example, should ultimately lead to falling electricity prices. And insofar as the inventory cycle returns, it will be a multiplier for lower prices when inventories are liquidated in a downturn. The ECB’s monetary policy response So, to sum up, we are currently facing a situation where lingering supply constraints are an important factor causing above-target inflation to persist for longer – and their effect is being exacerbated by the release of pent-up demand. In this setting, monetary policy needs to avoid deviations from our target becoming entrenched and return inflation to 2% in the medium term. Two considerations are important here. The first is the destination of monetary policy: we need to normalise policy, and be ready to adjust rates by as much as necessary to reach our inflation target in the medium term. The second consideration is the pace of rate increases: since interest rates are rising from very low levels, the pace of rate increases can mobilise the signalling channel of monetary policy directly. Let me address each of these points in turn. The destination of monetary policy First, when inflation is high and growth is constrained by inelastic supply, monetary policy cannot remain expansionary and add to inflationary pressures by pushing up demand. It is therefore appropriate to pursue a strategy of monetary policy normalisation. As I explained in a blog post earlier this year,[11] normalisation implies ending net asset purchases and then raising rates to neutral levels – so levels that are neither expansionary nor restrictive. That is why the ECB has not only started raising interest rates, but also communicated that we expect to raise interest rates further over the next several meetings. And to ensure that these changes in our policy stance are effective, we have taken several decisions over the last few months to preserve the orderly transmission of our stance throughout the euro area.[12] As we move forward, we will reassess whether a normalisation strategy is sufficient to bring us back to 2% inflation over the medium term. Ultimately, the terminal rate at which our hiking cycle ends must be compatible with inflation returning durably to our target – and that rate will depend on how the economic environment evolves around us. One key factor will be how the persistence of the shocks we are facing affects inflation expectations and potential output. If there were evidence that high inflation risked de-anchoring inflation expectations, then the policy rate that is compatible with our target would lie in restrictive territory. Similarly, were we to conclude that ongoing supply shocks had durably lowered economic potential, we would have to ensure that demand remains aligned with supply. Another key factor will be how the growth outlook affects inflation. Negative supply shocks will result in a growth slowdown, which will likely have an impact on the prevailing inflation rate. In past euro area recessions going back to the 1970s, headline inflation has fallen by about 1.1 percentage points a year later, while core inflation has fallen by about half that amount.[13] But this is not a hard-and-fast rule: in some recessionary episodes, such as those triggered by a worsening of supply conditions, inflation has stayed the same or even risen. In our downside scenario, which captures – among other shocks – the impact of a complete cut-off of Russian gas, we project that the economy will contract next year before picking up in 2024. But inflation is expected to be higher at the end of the projection horizon than in the baseline scenario.[14] A third factor will be the actions of governments. Monetary policy will do whatever is needed to return inflation to our target. But a truly European approach where monetary and fiscal policy complement each other can improve the inflation outlook. In particular, how fiscal policies support firms and households through the difficult winter ahead will play an important role in inflation dynamics. Targeted, temporary and tailored measures are needed to protect the incomes of the most vulnerable, while also preventing a significant loss of capacity owing to production cuts and bankruptcies. But beyond that, it will make a difference whether fiscal policy focuses mainly on public consumption and transfers – which may add to inflationary pressures – or on public investment and debt sustainability. As many of the sources of inflation today are on the supply side, government policies that lift supply and redirect investment to where it is needed are necessary to support sustainable growth. The pace of rate increases The second consideration in responding to current inflation is the pace of rate increases. When inflation is high for a long period of time, an important role for monetary policy is to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored as the shocks work their way through the economy. If expectations become de-anchored and trigger a wage-price spiral, it can lead to inflation becoming persistent even after the shocks disappear. Raising interest rates has a mechanical effect on demand and inflation, and thereby on inflation expectations. But when interest rates are starting from unusually low levels, rate hikes are more powerful if they also create signalling effects that influence expectations directly. In this context, especially compared with the traditional focus on 25 basis-point increments, adjusting the pace of rate hikes is a key tool to signal our determination to fulfil our mandate and keep inflation expectations contained. And moving faster at the start of the hiking cycle clearly conveys our commitment to bring down inflation to our medium-term target. At present, inflation expectations remain relatively well anchored across a range of measures. But there are two reasons why it would be unwise to take this for granted. First, the shock is severely affecting the prices of those consumption items, such as groceries and petrol, that have the greatest influence on households’ inflation expectations.[15] The ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey shows that, since February this year, both mean and median expectations for inflation three years ahead have risen by around 1 percentage point. Second, we are seeing a rapid change in the economic environment, with inflation switching from being very low to being extremely high. History suggests this can leave a scar on expectations. For example, research finds that differences in inflation expectations between people from the former East and West Germany can largely be explained by the lasting effect of the inflation shock after reunification. This contrasted strongly with the perceived norm of zero inflation in the German Democratic Republic and seems to have led former East Germans to over-adjust to an environment of rising prices.[16] This imperative to anchor inflation expectations helps explain why, over the last two policy meetings of the ECB’s Governing Council, we raised our key interest rates by 125 basis points in total. This is the fastest change in rates in our history and it has sent a strong signal of our determination to return inflation to our medium-term target in a timely manner. This major step also took into account the unusually low level of interest rates and the limited risk of overreacting at the start of the hiking cycle. Going forward, the appropriate pace of future rate increases will be decided on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Indeed, as we have repeatedly emphasised, we will remain data dependent in all scenarios. Where rates ultimately settle, and the size of the steps that we move in, will depend on how the inflation outlook evolves as we proceed. Conclusion Let me conclude. Inflation in the euro area has proven to be much higher and more persistent than originally projected. This reflects the unprecedented series of shocks we have faced, and the fact that those shocks have led to turning points in our economic environment. Monetary policy cannot prevent the first-round effects of many of these shocks. But it can ensure that they do not become embedded. This is what the ECB is doing. We have taken major steps along the path of normalising our monetary policy, frontloading our rate increases. This signals that we are determined to bring inflation back to our medium-term target of 2% in a timely manner and ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored. We will not let this phase of high inflation feed into economic behaviour and create a lasting inflation problem. Our monetary policy will be set with one goal in mind: to deliver on our price stability mandate. Rees, D. and Rungcharoenkitkul, P.

Washington, DC, 17 April 2024 Since the early 1990s, many central banks worldwide have adopted a framework for monetary policy known as “inflation targeting”.[1] In this framework, central banks announce a target rate or range for medium-term inflation, typically 2%, and adjust short-term interest rates to steer actual inflation towards the target.[2] The rise of inflation targeting was a response to the turbulent inflation episodes of the 1970s and 1980s when most central banks were only loosely committed to price stability. Inflation targeting was an acknowledgement that monetary policy was most effective when it was given a clear mandate. Inflation targeting went hand-in-hand with a discernible increase in central bank independence and transparency. Central banks operating outside the influence of political election cycles played a critical role in making inflation targeting credible and feasible. Political independence, in turn, required central bank officials to publicly explain and justify their actions as a manifestation of democratic accountability. Greater transparency was also needed to operationalise inflation targeting. The reason is that, given the lags in monetary policy transmission, central banks can only affect future inflation. As such, inflation targeting has typically been formulated in terms of inflation forecast targeting where the central bank adjusts policy to offset deviations of its projection of medium-term inflation from the target.[3] Inflation forecast targeting requires the central bank to provide a coherent narrative to the public that links its current decisions to the way it expects economic activity and inflation to evolve over the policy-relevant horizon, typically over the next two to three years. Inflation forecast targeting has been implemented differently across the central banking community. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Norges Bank and Sveriges Riksbank, for example, publish inflation forecasts that are conditional on a policy rate path consistent with delivering inflation in line with the target over the policy-relevant horizon. Similarly, the US Federal Reserve System provides policy rate forecasts through its Summary of Economic Projections. While these interest rate paths do not constitute a formal commitment on the part of policymakers, they do provide forward guidance, which potentially raises the ability of central banks to manage interest rate and inflation expectations.[4] Other central banks, including the ECB and the Bank of England, publish inflation projections based on financial market participants’ expected path for short-term interest rates.[5] In this case, the public typically expects policy to deviate from the market-implied path if the medium-term inflation forecast is inconsistent with the target. At the ECB, the link between policy decisions and inflation projections was deliberately diluted, as projections are “owned” by staff and not the Governing Council.[6] In practice, however, inflation projections, whether owned by the committee or not, have over time become the main communication vehicle for most central banks worldwide, including the ECB. Inflation forecast targeting and the surge in inflation Inflation targeting has generally been a success. Before the pandemic, inflation had been low and stable over three decades (Slide 2). And by providing a clear yardstick for the public to measure the central bank’s success in delivering on its mandate, inflation targeting has made monetary policy more transparent and accountable. Yet, while changes to monetary policy frameworks had been important in bringing about benign inflation outcomes since the late 1980s, there is broad agreement that during that period, central banks benefited from a decline in macroeconomic volatility and globally subdued price pressures.[7] In this environment, even systematic forecast errors by central banks had only limited impact on their credibility.[8] In the euro area, for example, HICP inflation excluding energy and food was persistently over-projected between 2013 and 2019 (Slide 3, left-hand side).[9] But since these forecast errors were small in absolute terms, and the public was not concerned about a limited undershooting of inflation targets, the appropriateness of central banks’ broader policy frameworks was not questioned, and neither was their ability to maintain price stability. However, the pandemic changed all of this. Inflation forecast errors rose measurably and remained persistent.[10] This was not because central banks were particularly bad at projecting inflation. After all, significant forecast errors were made by professional forecasters and international institutions alike (Slide 3, right-hand side). Rather, it was because the size of the shocks hitting our economies increased sharply, with some of them entailing fundamental structural changes to the economy, making inflation forecasting an extremely difficult undertaking. These forecast errors, in turn, arguably contributed to central banks’ delayed reaction to the surge in inflation. Data dependence challenges inflation forecast targeting Central banks are currently trying to draw the right lessons from recent experience. Perhaps the most important one is that the post-pandemic surge in inflation has validated rather than refuted the inflation targeting framework. Despite inflation often reaching double-digit levels, long-term inflation expectations have remained broadly anchored around 2% across advanced economies (Slide 4). This is a strong vote of confidence in the central bank’s determination and ability to restore price stability. By keeping inflation expectations anchored, central banks managed to significantly reduce the persistence of inflation, thereby helping avoid the output losses that had been necessary in the 1980s to bring inflation down from elevated levels. A second area of reflection relates to the role central bank projections should play in calibrating and communicating monetary policy. In response to the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the ECB adjusted the way it presented and used economic forecasts in its decision-making process. Alternative scenarios and extensive sensitivity analyses complemented the baseline and helped to convey the considerable increase in uncertainty regarding the future path of the economy. In addition, in early 2023, when interest rates had already been raised considerably, we clarified that the large prevailing uncertainty about the medium-term inflation outlook required a data-dependent approach to monetary policy, where the observed dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission would serve to cross-check the inflation projections.[11] These measures effectively marked a departure from “textbook” inflation forecast targeting. As projection errors, even over short horizons, rose to unprecedented levels in the wake of the recent energy crisis, the baseline scenario was no longer a sufficient summary indicator for calibrating and communicating monetary policy actions. Breaking this link was not entirely new. Already in 2019, following a long period of subdued price pressures, the ECB adopted rate forward guidance that conditioned its future actions not only on the inflation outlook but also on the actual progress in underlying inflation dynamics. This was also intended to ease financing conditions further. But in the high-inflation period, the stakes were arguably higher. Consider the June 2022 Eurosystem staff projections as an example. These projections were the first opportunity to fully reflect on the impact of the war in Ukraine on activity and prices in the euro area. They foresaw inflation to average 3.5% in 2023, almost two percentage points below the actual outcome of 5.4%, with interest rates being markedly higher than expected in 2022. Should we return to strict inflation forecast targeting? The question we are facing today is whether, in view of the recent normalisation of forecast errors, central banks should return to the strict inflation forecast targeting that prevailed most of the time before the pandemic. This question is not about whether central banks should use model-based forecasts or not. Good policymaking will always have to rely on models about how the economy works and how our policy decisions affect central macroeconomic variables. In other words, models are indispensable. It is not about whether central banks should be forward-looking, either. Again, there is no question that a central bank must focus on medium-term inflation. It should not form its decisions by looking only in the rear-view mirror. Instead, the question is whether we should give the baseline projections a weight in policy calibration and communication, so that deviations of projected medium-term inflation from the target would almost mechanically trigger expectations of policy adjustments. Clarity on how central banks intend to conduct policy over the medium term is certainly important for predictability and hence transmission. During the past few months, financial markets have repeatedly repriced the future expected path of short-term interest rates in different directions, thereby affecting actual financing conditions (Slide 5).[12] These swings do not necessarily imply a lack of understanding of central banks’ reaction functions, as there was often a wedge between the medium-term inflation outlook expected by investors and central banks. But they do suggest that investors expect policymakers, at least for now, to continue to pay more attention to actual inflation outcomes, or to the tails of the forecast distribution, than what a typical inflation forecast targeting central bank would do. Putting less weight on the baseline forecast in the decision-making process has two drawbacks. First, it may lead to excessive volatility if financial markets overreact to individual data prints. The sensitivity of short-term interest rates to surprises in the most relevant macroeconomic indicators is currently at elevated levels (Slide 6). Second, it could increase the risk that, should the central scenario materialise, monetary policymakers may have waited too long to adjust the stance in their search for “sufficient confidence”. In the current context, being behind the curve can be costly in terms of lost output. At the same time, despite the reduction in forecasting errors, there are a number of reasons suggesting that it could be prudent to continue to consider the baseline forecast as just one input to policy decisions, or to consider other changes to the framework, including in communication, even as inflation continues to fall. Central forecasts create a false sense of precision First, while central forecasts are easy to communicate, they convey a false sense of precision. At the ECB, significant resources are constantly devoted to improving the set of models used for forecasting.[13] After the global financial crisis, for example, credit and banking gained prominence in our workhorse models. More recently, we made important changes to the assumptions about the pass-through of energy prices to consumer prices in the presence of large cost-push shocks.[14] But no matter how much we improve our models, projections will always be surrounded by a significant degree of uncertainty. Take energy inflation as an example. During the recent inflation surge, errors in the conditioning assumptions for energy prices – based on market futures prices – explained, on average, about three-quarters of the Eurosystem and ECB staff projection errors for inflation four quarters ahead (Slide 7). While other forecasting techniques, such as using random walk assumptions, may sometimes yield superior outcomes, there is no one method that consistently outperforms the others. Uncertainty is even greater when estimating and forecasting unobservable variables, such as the output gap or the natural rate of interest. While being of first-order importance for assessing inflationary pressures or the restrictiveness of monetary policy, neither concept can be pinned down in real time with any reasonable degree of precision. In addition, forecasts of models estimated on historical time series tend to revert to the mean towards the end of the projection horizon. This mean reversion is an integral part of inflation targeting, based on the assumption that long-term inflation expectations are firmly anchored at target. This approach is reasonable for as long as this assumption is confirmed by surveys and market prices. But when shocks are large and persistent, and inflation expectations are at risk of de-anchoring, mean reversion can make monetary policy procyclical. Consequently, there is a risk that policymakers react too late when the economy is hit by a more persistent inflation shock, and that policy is loosened too early when inflation falls again. In other words, mean reversion introduces an easing bias during inflation shocks and a tightening bias during disinflation shocks. Biases may also occur due to the incremental approach typically used in forecasting when new projections start from the most recent vintage. This may lead to an excessive degree of inertia, especially at turning points, which models typically have a hard time anticipating given the lack of tools to identify changes in the trajectory of key economic variables in real time. The use of judgement can partly compensate for such shortcomings. However, the line between technical and policy judgement is often blurred. And in a large monetary policy committee, such as the Eurosystem, where the projection process has deliberately been delegated to staff, policy judgement should ideally be the outcome of deliberations rather than an input to the baseline scenario. Supply-side shocks make inflation forecasting more difficult Second, inflation forecast targeting typically relies on the assumption that supply side shocks are transitory, meaning changes in economic activity result predominately from changes in aggregate demand along a balanced steady-state growth path. As monetary policy works mainly on the demand side, it can be optimally adjusted to offset the impact of expected changes in activity on prices and wages, taking into account the lags in policy transmission. This is the “divine coincidence” at work. However, these might not be the kind of conditions facing central banks in the foreseeable future.[15] Last year, in her speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, ECB President Christine Lagarde laid out the significant potential for pervasive and persistent shocks to affect the supply side and hence wages, inflation and interest rates.[16] Examples are climate change, the rapid ageing of our population and the rise of generative artificial intelligence. In addition, the nature of globalisation is changing fundamentally. Not only are firms reconsidering the robustness of their value chains in the light of significant geopolitical uncertainties, they are also facing fiercer global competition in many areas. China, in particular, is transitioning away from being the world’s manufacturing base towards becoming a major player in high-tech industries, such as electric vehicles. Over the past few years, Chinese firms have rapidly gained global market shares (Slide 8, left-hand side). These developments are unfolding alongside the persistent effects of the recent shocks to our economies. It is becoming increasingly clear that the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine are having long-lasting, if not permanent, effects on the euro area economy. For example, despite the significant drop in energy prices, the output of energy-intensive industries, such as chemicals and basic metals, has dropped considerably more than that of other sectors over the past two years (Slide 8, right-hand side). The pandemic, meanwhile, has exacerbated the secular decline in hours worked per person employed. Today, people are working on average 2% fewer hours compared with the five-year average before the pandemic, contributing to labour shortages (Slide 9, left-hand side). At the same time, we are seeing a strong rebound in the labour force, owing largely to the contribution from foreign workers (Slide 9, right-hand side).[17] However, over time this increase in the labour force may be countered, and possibly more than offset, by the projected decline in the domestic working-age population. Overall, these supply-side shocks are difficult to anticipate and can have very different effects on wages and inflation than shocks triggered by changes in aggregate demand, making inflation forecast targeting considerably more challenging. State-dependent monetary policy transmission complicates policy calibration Finally, inflation forecast targeting relies on a stable and effective transmission of monetary policy, so that changes in the monetary policy stance have the desired and predicted effects on projected inflation. The experience over the past ten years, however, has challenged our understanding of the way changes in short- and long-term interest rates affect output and inflation. Before the pandemic, record low, and even negative, interest rates failed to provide sufficient stimulus to lift the economy out of a low-growth, low-inflation environment. Evidence is pointing increasingly towards monetary policy transmission to activity and prices being highly non-linear, with diminishing returns when financing conditions are very loose.[18] Today, researchers are trying to reconcile the surprising resilience shown by parts of the economy with the sharpest tightening cycle in decades. This resilience is most evident in the United States where growth remains surprisingly buoyant. But questions about the strength and lags of policy transmission have emerged across a broad range of economies. Evidence from the euro area, for example, is increasingly consistent with the view that monetary policy transmission is highly state-dependent. During the current tightening cycle, large cash positions held by firms, a rotation of spending from goods to services, a high share of fixed-rate mortgages, comparatively healthy borrower balance sheets and resilient employment amid persistently tight labour markets may all have dampened policy transmission. Even though a considerable amount of effort is made to understand all these channels, anticipating them in real time is inherently difficult. They typically only become visible once transmission is at a more advanced stage, making policy calibration based narrowly on projections a difficult exercise. This is even more the case if structural shocks also affect the natural rate of interest, creating uncertainty about the degree of restrictiveness of current monetary policy.[19] Dot plots and alternative scenarios could offer solutions The question, then, is how policy frameworks can be adjusted to deal with these challenges for calibrating policy and communicating decisions to the public. Last week, Ben Bernanke presented possible solutions in his review of the Bank of England’s forecasting framework.[20] Some of the points he raised could also be of relevance to the ECB. One area of reflection relates to whether policymakers’ views on their expected future path of short-term interest rates should be made more transparent, akin to the “dot plot” used by the Federal Reserve System.[21] The distribution of these paths could help signal the risks members of the committee attach to the baseline scenario built by staff. The narrower the distribution, the stronger the implied endorsement by policymakers, and vice versa.[22] A dot plot can therefore help convey the uncertainty about the future path of the economy and simultaneously provide greater clarity about where policymakers see interest rates moving in the future, potentially working against excessive market volatility. A downside to the publication of interest rate paths is that they may overly condition market pricing, thereby de facto reducing its informational content. Recent research shows that the dot plots may have lowered US real long-term bond yields by around 130 basis points over the last decade.[23] A second, and complementary, option is to systematically include alternative scenarios to communicate the uncertainty around central bank projections more directly. By looking at different and potentially equally realistic paths for growth and inflation, there may no longer be a central scenario. The ECB conducts scenario analyses frequently. The most recent projection report looked at how an escalation of disruptions in the Red Sea could affect output and inflation in the euro area.[24] Our technical assumptions are also subject to regular sensitivity analysis. At present, for example, the option-implied gas price distribution indicates pronounced upside risks to the March 2024 baseline scenario. These alternative scenarios and sensitivity analyses, however, are currently not receiving the weight and attention they deserve among central bank watchers, with most focusing narrowly on the point forecast of inflation two to three years ahead. One reason for this might be that the scenarios we consider are, in most cases, partial rather than general equilibrium, or restricted to tail events, meaning that they do not seriously challenge the main narrative underlying the baseline scenario. To signal more clearly the significant uncertainty surrounding the baseline, realistic alternative scenarios – possibly presenting the range of views within the committee – could test some of the main assumptions feeding the baseline. The challenges currently facing the euro area demonstrate how this could be done. In one scenario, monetary policy is expected to succeed in creating conditions such that firms will absorb large parts of current high unit labour cost growth in their profit margins alongside a recovery in labour productivity growth. In this case, underlying price pressures would gradually abate, and inflation would return to, or even undershoot, the target over the projection horizon. This is broadly the narrative underlying the current ECB and Eurosystem staff projections. Such a scenario could be augmented with additional sensitivity analysis, examining, for instance, by how much inflation could undershoot the target if the effects of monetary policy were stronger than usually. In an alternative scenario, productivity growth would remain depressed over the projection horizon and demand for less interest-rate sensitive services could remain sufficiently strong to allow firms to pass a larger share of the increase in labour costs on to consumers. This scenario would take into account that the capacity of firms in the services sector to absorb rising input costs is more limited than in other sectors, such as industry or agriculture, where profits have been rising much more forcefully over the past years and where falling input prices have created space to absorb other cost increases. Overall, in this scenario, underlying price pressures could be stickier and the return of inflation to the 2% target delayed. The regular and consistent use of such scenarios could better convey the uncertainty facing central banks and contribute to making policy decisions more robust by considering a range of plausible outcomes. Conclusion All this suggests, and with this I would like to conclude, that returning to the pre-pandemic policy framework, which relied heavily on central banks adjusting and communicating policy around a central inflation forecast, may come with risks. This framework may thus require a deeper re-think, even if inflation is getting closer to levels consistent with price stability. As part of this re-think, central banks will need to carefully evaluate the role the central forecast should play in an environment characterised by higher macroeconomic volatility and persistent supply-side shocks, and how projections could be made more robust in order to place policymaking on a firmer footing, while allowing for clear and transparent communication about the inherent uncertainty. Thank you. To date, 35 of the 36 OECD members have adopted some form of inflation targeting. See Rose, A.

(2010), “Central bank communication and expectations stabilization”, American Economic Journal, Vol. 2, pp. 235-271. Some central banks, including the Bank of England, also publish inflation projections based on the assumption of constant interest rates. The projections are published four times a year: March and September projections are produced by ECB staff, while June and December projections are produced jointly by Eurosystem and ECB staff. In the academic literature, this distinction is known as the “good policy” versus “good luck” hypothesis. See Bernanke, B. (2004), “The Great Moderation”, remarks at the meetings of the Eastern Economic Association, Washington, DC, 20 February; Perez-Quiros, G. and McConnell, M.

(2002), “Has the Business Cycle Changed and Why?”, NBER Macroeconomics Annual, Vol. 17. The advance of inflation targeting is believed to be a prime reason why the global financial crisis of 2008 merely interrupted the Great Moderation. Afterwards, macroeconomic volatility quickly dropped back to its previous low levels. See, for example, Waller, C. and Crews, J.

In October of last year, for example, markets priced in a high-for-longer environment before pivoting sharply to expecting significant policy easing, taking comfort from the sharp decline in observed inflation. The subsequent slowdown in the pace of disinflation contributed to a partial reversal of these moves, even though central bank forecasts were increasingly signalling that inflation was expected to fall towards the target over the medium term and to remain near that level thereafter. See, for example, Ciccarelli et al. (2024), “ECB macroeconometric models for forecasting and policy analysis”, Occasional Paper Series, ECB, No 344. The past few years have demonstrated that firms are unlikely to change their prices at regular intervals over time, as our models typically assume. Rather, firms tend to adjust their prices more frequently when faced with large cost-push shocks, while being slower to pass cost savings on to consumers, affecting monetary policy transmission.

Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Institute of International and European Affairs, Dublin Dublin, 27 May 2024 Introduction The aim of this speech is to examine inflation in the euro area. In the next section, I review the various inflation indicators tracked by the ECB.[1] Subsequently, I discuss the implications for monetary policy. Overview of Inflation Indicators Chart 1 shows the evolution of headline and core inflation since 2019. Let me focus on the disinflation patterns since August 2023 (the month immediately prior to our last rate hike at our September monetary policy meeting). Inflation declined from 5.2 per cent last August to 2.4 percent in April, while core inflation decreased from 5.3 per cent in August to 2.7 per cent in April. Chart 1 Headline inflation and core inflation (annual percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat. Notes: HICP refers to headline inflation and HICPX to HICP excluding food and energy. The latest observation are for April 2024. Chart 2 shows the relative contributions of the major categories: energy; food; goods; and services. Services inflation now accounts for the vast bulk of the overall inflation rate. In turn, this reflects the non-uniform dynamics: while the other categories have seen major declines, with the April data indicating energy inflation running at -0.6 per cent, food inflation at 2.8 per cent and goods inflation at 0.9 per cent, services inflation was still elevated at 3.7 per cent. Chart 2 HICP decomposition (annual percentage changes and percentage point contributions) Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations. Notes: Goods refers to non-energy industrial goods. The latest observations are for April 2024. Chart 3 shows the evolution of the refined versions of the underlying inflation measures tracked by the ECB, which adjust for the temporary impact of energy shocks and supply bottlenecks.[2] The improvements in these measures since August 2023 suggest that the observed disinflation has a substantial persistent component. Chart 3 Adjusted measures of underlying inflation (annual percentage changes Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations.Notes: HICP refers to headline inflation, HICPX to HICP excluding food and energy, HICPXX to HICP excluding food, energy, travel-related items and clothing, and PCCI to the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation. The “adjusted” measures abstract from energy and global supply bottleneck shocks using a large structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model S as explained in Bańbura, M., Bobeica, E. and Martínez Hernández, C. (2023), “What drives core inflation? The role of supply shocks”, Working Paper Series, No 2875, ECB. The latest observations are for April 2024. While Chart 3 reports broad measures of underlying inflation, Chart 4 examines the domestic inflation rate, which is aggregated across sectors with low import content. The focus on this measure is motivated by the higher sensitivity of domestic inflation to local cost pressures. Although domestic inflation remains quite elevated, the exclusion-type indicators (weighted median and trimmed measures) suggest that the breadth of the domestic inflation dynamic is narrowing. Chart 4 Domestic inflation (annual percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations.Notes: Domestic inflation is an aggregate of HICP items with a relatively low import intensity, as explained in Fröhling, A., O’Brien, D. and Schaefer, S. (2022), “A new indicator of domestic inflation for the euro area”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 4, ECB. The latest observations are for April 2024. In a similar vein, Chart 5 shows services inflation. In April, services inflation declined slightly to 3.7 per cent. The decline in services inflation since last summer has largely been in non-labour-intensive services sectors, reflecting the indirect impact of lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the fading out of pandemic reopening effects in these sectors. As shown in Chart 5, there is a relatively tight medium-term relation between wage inflation and the inflation rate for labour-intensive services sectors (which make up a large part of the domestic inflation component). Over time, deceleration in wage growth is necessary in order for services inflation to converge to a rate that is consistent with meeting the two per cent target for overall inflation.[3] Chart 5 Services inflation developments (annual percentage changes) Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.Note: Latest observations are for the fourth quarter of 2023 for compensation per employee and April 2024 for the rest. In relation to wage dynamics, Chart 6 shows the evolution of compensation per employee and compensation per hour until Q4 2023 and negotiated wages until Q1 2024, while Chart 7 shows a set of wage trackers.[4] The ECB wage tracker – an important tool used to assess wage developments across the euro area – is signalling that overall wage pressures have moderated since 2023.[5] Furthermore, the Indeed wage tracker – which reflects the wages offered in job postings and thereby should be a leading indicator for overall wage dynamics – has materially decelerated in recent months.[6] At the same time, wage growth is expected to remain elevated in 2024, and to show a bumpy profile. These developments reflect the staggered nature of the wage adjustment process as workers continue to recoup real wage losses from past price shocks, as well as the important role of one-off payments in this process. Such one-off payments are also behind the increase in euro area negotiated wage growth in the first quarter. Similarly, one-off payments likely played a significant role in the increase in the growth rate of the “wages and salaries” component in the experimental flash release for Eurostat’s labour cost index (LCI) for Q1 2024, which jumped to 5.0 per cent from 3.2 per cent in Q4 2023. The impact of higher wages on price pressures depends on the rate of labour productivity growth. In 2023, labour productivity fell, such that unit labour costs grew more quickly than wages. Preliminary data for the first quarter of 2024 suggest that aggregate labour productivity was constant; given the strongly pro-cyclical behaviour of labour productivity, the March staff projections foresee labour productivity growing at 0.1 per cent in 2024, 1.2 per cent in 2025 and 1.2 per cent in 2026 due to the output recovery outpacing employment growth.[7] Under this baseline, unit labour costs will grow more slowly than nominal wages. In addition to a slower rate of growth of labour costs, deceleration in domestic inflation also requires compression in profits. The annual growth in unit profits peaked at 9.4 per cent in the last quarter of 2022 and stood at 2.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023. The March projections exercise foresees unit profit growth turning negative in 2024, implying that profits will buffer the relatively strong labour cost growth. Unit profit growth is then expected to recover somewhat from 2025, helped by a robust economic recovery and strengthening productivity growth.

Even if inflation does not smoothly decline during the rest of 2024, further disinflation can be expected in the course of 2025. This next phase of disinflation should be underpinned by the lowering of labour cost pressures, ongoing compression of unit profits, the dissipation of the adverse effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the pandemic reopening, and the further unfolding of the disinflationary impact of the restrictive monetary policy stance. This disinflationary dynamic is consistent with both inflation stabilising at our target later in 2025 and a substantial economic recovery. The latter will be supported by rising real incomes, improvements in the terms of trade and the prospect of disinflation unlocking future interest rate reductions and boosting domestic consumption and investment, while the normalisation of foreign demand will facilitate growth in exports. The sustainable attainment of the medium-term inflation target would be difficult in the absence of sufficient growth to foster the demand conditions that would be aligned with an overall inflation rate of two per cent. Finally, it is essential to track the evolution of inflation risk, in addition to indicators of the expected inflation path. The lowering of perceived inflation risk since last summer is plausibly connected to the faster-than-expected decline in inflation (even if this has somewhat reversed in the initial months of 2024): the September 2023 staff projections pencilled in 2024 inflation at 3.2 per cent, while the March projections revised 2024 inflation down to 2.3 per cent. Since last summer, a range of measures show that near-term inflation expectations have also come down and that the risk of inflation staying above target in the long term has diminished: the right tail in the distribution of long-term inflation expectations in the Survey of Professional Forecasters has markedly diminished compared to the peak inflation phase in late 2022; the inflation risk premium embedded in five-year-on-five-year inflation swaps has declined by about 40 basis points since last summer; the option-implied probability of above 2.5 per cent inflation in the five-year-on-five-year interval has dropped, while the option-implied probability of below 1.5 per cent inflation has picked up; to the Consumer Expectations Survey, households have recognised the improvement in inflation outcomes and marked down their near-term inflation expectations; according to the results from the SAFE, firms have lowered their near-term inflation expectations, while the proportion of firms fearing high inflation in the medium term has decreased.[8] Implications for monetary policy The role of monetary policy in the disinflation process has been to ensure that the large inflation shocks did not translate into an increase in the medium-term inflation trend through medium-term inflation expectations shifting above our two per cent target. This has required a substantial adjustment in monetary policy for two reasons: first, in the normalisation phase, to avoid that excessively-low nominal interest rates would pro-cyclically add to the initial inflation shock; and, second, in the restrictiveness phase, to make sure that demand conditions are dampened, so as to ensure that the multi-round adjustment process for prices and wages is consistent with a timely return of inflation to the two per cent target. Put differently, the aim of a restrictive monetary policy stance is to limit the persistence of backward-looking inflation dynamics and steer forward-looking inflation dynamics towards the medium-term anchor. While backward-looking inflation dynamics continue to play out (especially in relation to domestic/services inflation), these should continue to ease over the next year due to several factors: (a) with significant progress in 2023 and 2024 in reversing the real wage gap that was generated by the 2021-2022 inflation surge, wage growth should be lower in 2025 than in 2024; (b) with 2024 inflation lower than 2023 inflation, there will be less catch-up pressure from post-shock inflation on prices and wages in 2025; (c) the upward impact from the reversal of fiscal measures and energy base effects will be less relevant in 2025 than in 2024; and (d) the lagged impact of monetary policy tightening will still be contributing significantly to disinflation dynamics during 2025. With forward-looking inflation expectations well anchored, the dissipation of the backward-looking component will underpin the convergence in inflation towards the target. At our June meeting, if our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. Among other considerations, the subsequent pace of rate cuts will be slower if there are upward surprises to underlying inflation (especially in relation to the underlying dynamics of domestic inflation and services inflation) and the level of demand (in view of the implications of demand conditions for the medium-term inflation outlook) and will be faster if there are downward surprises to underlying inflation and the level of demand.[9] The future rate path will also depend on the evolving strength of monetary transmission. First, given the lags in transmission, the tightening effects from our past interest rate hikes are still unfolding. While the impact of the tightening cycle on economic activity might have reached its maximum level at the turn of this year, model-based analysis suggests that the bulk of the impact on inflation is comparatively backloaded, with substantial pass-through still expected to transpire in the period ahead.[10] Second, with expected inflation at various horizons now lower than at the date of our last rate hike, a given nominal interest rate now maps into a higher real interest rate. It is straightforward that the calibration of the appropriate degree of restrictiveness should adjust for the impact of lower expected inflation. Third, the overall restrictiveness of aggregate financial conditions also depends on the evolution of term premia and risk premia. Among other factors, these will be influenced by developments in global financial markets. The future rate path will also be guided by our management of the two-sided risks in proceeding through the next phase. In one direction, easing the stance too quickly would not be consistent with inflation sustainably returning to target if inflation turns out to be more persistent than anticipated. In the other direction, keeping rates overly restrictive for too long could push inflation below target over the medium term. This would require corrective action through a subsequent acceleration in rate cuts that could even require having to descend to below-neutral levels to fix any persistent drift towards a below-target inflation trend. In deciding on the appropriate policy rate path, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. This approach has served us well in the tightening cycle and many of the same considerations will apply during the unwinding phase.[11] In relation to staff projections of various indicators, I rely on the March 2024 exercise. The projections from the June 2024 exercise will be published after our 6 June monetary policy meeting. See Bańbura, M., Bobeica, E., Bodnar, K., Fagandini, B., Healy, P. and Paredes, J.

Handelsblatt Jahrestagung “Zukunftstrategien für Sparkassen und Landesbanken”, Berlin, 2 February 2017 Introduction The euro area recovery is progressing at a moderate, but firming pace.[1] The economy has now posted positive real GDP growth for 14 consecutive quarters. The unemployment rate is back to a single-digit figure. Economic sentiment is at the highest level recorded in almost 6 years. The monetary policy measures the ECB has taken over the past few years have contributed decisively to these positive developments. After having hovered at levels well below 1% for three years, euro area HICP inflation has edged up towards the end of last year and, according to preliminary data, reached 1.8%, in January. The recent upward movement of inflation mainly reflects temporary factors, most notably the increases in energy and food prices. By contrast, underlying inflationary pressures have remained subdued and inflation excluding food and energy has mostly remained below 1% since late 2013. The current environment still falls short of a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation to levels closer to 2% over the medium term. It will take time for inflation to stabilise around levels consistent with our price stability objective. Recent developments show the role monetary policy plays in driving the economic recovery and, further down the road, in ensuring a durable return of inflation to levels close to 2%. By supporting highly accommodative financial and credit conditions, our current monetary policy stance is underpinning the recovery of the euro area economy. The gradual reabsorption of economic slack is working its way through to underlying inflation. Continued monetary policy support is necessary to ensure a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This assessment was the motive for the Governing Council’s decision of December last year to extend the asset purchases until the end of 2017 – or beyond, if necessary. It is conditional on the continuing support from these and past measures that we expect to see a return of inflation to levels closer to 2% over the medium term. In providing the necessary degree of monetary accommodation going forward, the ECB will continue to adhere to its monetary policy strategy, that is look through transitory changes in inflation and remain focused on underlying inflation dynamics. The ups and downs of monthly data are not relevant if they are temporary and have no implications for the medium term outlook for price stability. I will focus my remarks today on the relationship between economic activity and inflation. Eurosystem staff analysis has identified a large degree of economic slack as an important factor behind subdued inflation dynamics in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis. Despite the ensuing economic recovery, other – mainly cyclical – forces have been exerting disinflationary pressures. These forces, which are partly external and partly domestic, have masked the relationship between economic slack and inflation, and have been reinforced by a weakening of inflation expectations. Forces slowing down inflation in the euro area economy[2] The euro area recovery has been characterised by a disconnect between economic activity and inflation – which some have referred to as a “missing inflation puzzle”. This disconnect becomes visible, for instance, when comparing actual growth and inflation outcomes for 2016 with those anticipated in the ECB staff macroeconomic projections of March 2014. The real GDP growth rate, which stood at 1.7% in 2016, essentially confirmed the March 2014 projection. HICP inflation, by contrast, turned out to be more than 1 percentage point below the rate projected in March 2014; and measures of core inflation, which strip out the direct disinflationary impact of the collapse of commodity prices over this period, have remained at 0.9%, about half the rate projected earlier. This picture points to pronounced disinflationary forces that have confounded attempts to forecast the impact of improved economic conditions on inflation. Where do these forces come from? Do they pertain to cyclical influences that monetary policy can offset? Do they reflect broader structural shifts in the economy that the central bank is forced to watch as a bystander? When answering these questions, it is useful to subdivide the inflation process into three factors, comprising: first, economic slack, measured by the output or unemployment gaps, for instance; second, a range of other domestic and global macroeconomic shocks that drive a wedge between that relationship, affecting either production costs or price mark-ups; and, third, inflation expectations, which feature as the – possibly time-varying – trend in this statistical relationship. Following this logic, summarised by the well-known Phillips curve, recent research has explored whether the disconnect between inflation and the economic recovery may have derived from a genuine change in the causal relationship between economic slack and inflation, or from a prevalence of disinflationary pressures originating from other sources, including potential shocks and a downward shift of inflation expectations, which could have more than offset the typical impact of slack on inflation. The relationship between inflation and economic slack With regard to the first dimension, the bulk of the evidence confirms that domestic cyclical conditions have played an important role in explaining disinflationary pressures. Domestic factors have been found to be the main driver of disinflation between 2012 and 2014, and have continued to weigh on inflation thereafter. Measures of economic slack, in particular, have proven informative in forecasting inflation outcomes. Moreover, Eurosystem staff calculations, using various combinations of economic activity indicators and inflation expectation measures, have found that more than 80% of the standard estimated Phillips-curve specifications confirm a significant relationship also during the more recent period of disinflation. These observations confirm that the relationship between economic activity and inflation, as postulated by the Phillips curve, has continued to play a role at the euro area level.[3] The link between inflation and economic slack is complicated by several factors. On the one hand, the degree to which prices respond to slack may depend on the state of the business cycle and could change, in particular, in severe and protracted recessions. The empirical evidence on such non-linearities, however, is not conclusive. On the other hand, secular shifts in the economy may have altered the relationship between inflation and economic slack. For instance, the trend towards a deeper integration of the global economy over the last decades is likely to have increased the importance of global relative to local conditions in shaping domestic cost and price pressures. A further often-cited factor is demographics – and especially the trend towards greater longevity – which may have interacted with cyclical conditions by inducing households to save more and, ultimately, put downward pressure on inflation.[4] Empirical evidence on this issue is inconclusive and demographics would only have lasting effects on the economy if left unattended by monetary policy. Overall, these observations have three important implications for monetary policy. First, the evidence confirms that the core Phillips curve connection linking inflation formation to resource utilisation remains a key ingredient in explaining the prevailing disinflationary pressures. Second, this finding implies that monetary policy, which typically affects the level of slack by steering financing and credit conditions in the economy, also retains significant influence on inflation outcomes. Third, domestic slack has not been the only disinflationary factor. To understand the drivers of low inflation, we thus need to look further afield – for instance, at shocks that have driven a wedge between the underlying relationship between inflation and economic slack in recent years. Cost and mark-up shocks Cost and mark-up shocks are forces that may have reinforced the disinflationary pressures exerted by economic slack during the crisis, while offsetting the inflationary pressures generated by the gradual reabsorption of slack thereafter. In the Phillips curve framework, such shocks would materialise as downward shifts of the curve that counteract upward movements along the curve on account of the compression of slack. One such force is a shock to the cost structure of firms, deriving, for instance, from fluctuations in import prices. The fall in oil prices to historically low levels between 2014 and 2015 is a prominent example of this type of shock as it directly reduces firms’ production costs, as confirmed by ECB staff analysis.[5] According to the same analysis, the drag of global factors on inflation has, indeed, more than compensated for the improvements in domestic drivers. Changes in firms’ ability to charge mark-ups over their own production costs can further blur the observed relationship between inflation and economic slack. Technological advancements, while also reducing distribution costs, can limit firms’ pricing power by facilitating price discovery by customers. For example, the advent of online retail platforms has greatly increased price transparency among consumers as the share of people searching for information online has risen continuously in the euro area. The downward pressure on mark-ups and, hence, prices associated with the spread of e-commerce is consistent with an erosion of euro area firms’ profit margins, which did not return to their pre-crisis levels until late 2014. Empirical analysis does not, however, find robust evidence that mark-up shocks have been a particularly dominant determinant of disinflationary tendencies since the crisis. In any case, these forces are only temporary: they can move inflation away from its long-run trend, even for a protracted period of time, but cannot affect trend inflation itself, unless they infiltrate inflation expectations. It is through inflation expectations that shocks to the inflation formation process which would otherwise have no relevance for a central bank can become a monetary policy problem. This brings me to the third element in the Phillips curve – its intercept – which is determined by inflation expectations. Inflation expectations In normal conditions, longer-term inflation expectations should be unaffected by transitory shocks, which typically dissipate over the medium term. However, recurrent shocks leading to a protracted period of low inflation can be misinterpreted as a lasting decline in trend inflation, and could jeopardise public faith in the central bank’s commitment or ability to deliver on its objective. As a consequence, the shocks can become entrenched in expectations. In such cases, firms and households become more attentive to past inflation outcomes and less attentive to the inflation norm or central bank inflation target when forming their expectations about future price developments. To the extent that these expectations enter wage and price-setting decisions in the economy, low inflation may become self-reinforcing: observed disinflation translates into a downgrade of inflation expectations, which in turn feeds back into lasting disinflation. Evidence on the evolution of inflation expectations during the crisis indicates that this scenario was a concrete risk that the euro area was facing in mid-2014. For instance, staff estimates suggest that market-based longer-term inflation expectations became more than 1.5 times more sensitive to macroeconomic surprises than they had been in pre-crisis times. By contrast, if longer-term inflation expectations are well-anchored, they do not respond to shorter-term macroeconomic developments. Instead, they remain entirely determined by the inflation objective that the central bank has committed to attain. But, especially after the oil price shocks in the second half of 2014, most measures for the sensitivity of inflation expectations have edged up.[6] The observation of a weaker anchoring of inflation expectations, in principle, is consistent with different interpretations. It might reflect doubts either with regard to the central bank’s commitment to pursue its objective, or with regard to the central bank’s ability to achieve its aim. Available evidence tends to favour the latter interpretation: the sensitivity of inflation expectations has increased more at shorter maturities, which is indicative of agents expecting that it will take longer for the central bank to bring inflation back to levels consistent with its objective; at very long maturities, by contrast, the increase in sensitivity was contained, which may reveal that agents have never quite lost faith in the intention of the central bank to respect its mandate. This evidence has crucial implications for monetary policy: many forces have combined to bring strong downward pressures to bear on the euro area economy and are slowing down the return of inflation to levels closer to our objective. But, importantly, these disinflationary forces are not beyond the remit of monetary policy. And it is precisely these underlying drivers behind trend inflation in recent years – rather than transient price dynamics with no implications for the medium-term inflation outlook – that have triggered the comprehensive package of monetary policy measures we have adopted since mid-2014. Maintaining price stability over the medium term Headline inflation had started its decline already in late 2011, and has been falling short of the ECB’s price stability objective – a medium-term inflation rate below, but close to 2% – since early 2013. Initially, in line with the strategic prescription of avoiding an over-reaction to short-term factors driving inflation, the ECB looked through short-term developments. In the summer of 2014, the persistence of disinflationary forces could be clearly identified: first, measures of underlying inflation had been drifting down in synch with headline inflation for more than a year, and had reached historical lows.[7] Second, for the first time since the inception of Monetary Union, longer-term inflation expectations had started to fall as well. Such fundamental risks to price stability required a forceful monetary policy response. Accordingly, the ECB deployed a series of unconventional monetary policy measures to ensure price stability. The comprehensive package of June 2014 comprised targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and a cut of the deposit facility rate, moving it into negative territory. This package was combined with a, to start with, small asset purchase programme initially involving only private sector securities, which was later expanded to include public sector securities (becoming known as the public sector purchase programme – PSPP) and then scaled up over time. These measures were accompanied by further cuts in the deposit facility rate and further TLTROs; moreover, they have been complemented by our forward guidance. This package has delivered a broad-based easing of euro area financial conditions since June 2014: money market conditions have improved substantially; long-term government bond yields, corporate and bank bond yields, as well as bank lending rates to firms and households, have declined markedly; and positive credit growth has returned to the euro area.[8] The exceptionally favourable financial conditions have helped the economy recover from the shock waves of the financial and sovereign debt crises. They have insulated the recovery from global headwinds that have engulfed the euro area over the last two years, such as the tensions in global financial markets in August 2015 and the slowdown of global demand since the first half of 2015. More recently, the firming recovery has also broadened across countries and sectors. As regards inflation dynamics, our determined policy actions have been material in warding off deflation. They have also contributed to a re-anchoring of long-term inflation expectations. Market-based measures of inflation expectations, however, have not yet returned to their pre-crisis levels. Underlying inflation dynamics remain subdued, and risks and uncertainties still prevail, especially those related to the geopolitical environment. To sum up, the ongoing economic recovery is still predicated to a large extent on very favourable financing conditions that, in turn, depend on continued monetary policy support. The firming recovery is not yet sufficiently robust to ensure a self-sustained convergence of inflation rates to levels closer to 2%. Overall, our monetary policy measures are effective, and are gradually bringing inflation back to a path that is consistent with price stability over the medium term. This takes time, and it requires determination and patience. [1]I would like to thank Sören Radde and Fédéric Holm-Hadulla for their contributions to this speech. [2]See Ciccarelli, M. and Osbat, C. (eds.), “Low inflation in the euro area: Causes and consequences”, Occasional Paper Series, No 181, European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, January 2017, and the references cited therein. [3]At the level of individual euro area countries, a large proportion of specifications also displays a significant Phillips curve slope, albeit with the exception of some euro area countries, probably on account of confounding factors related to global exposures and persistent structural changes. However, the finding that domestic cyclical conditions were an important driver of the disinflationary period from 2012 to 2014 is common to all countries. [4]Theoretically, the impact of population ageing on inflation may go both ways, but the bulk of the literature points to a negative effect.

Now, the global recovery is firming and broadening. A key issue facing policymakers is ensuring that this nascent growth becomes sustainable. Dynamic investment that drives stronger productivity growth is crucial for that – and in turn for the eventual normalisation of monetary policy. Investment and productivity growth together can unleash a virtuous circle, so that strong growth becomes durable and self-sustaining and, ultimately, is no longer dependent on a sizeable monetary policy stimulus. The discussions we will have over the next two days – in particular understanding the puzzles of slowing productivity growth and persistently low investment – are therefore highly relevant for the path of the economy and of our monetary policy. Yet as we anticipate the problems of tomorrow, we must also work on the issues of today. For central banks, this means addressing an unusual situation. We see growth above trend and well distributed across the euro area, but inflation dynamics remain more muted than one would expect on the basis of output gap estimates and historical patterns. An accurate diagnosis of this apparent contradiction is crucial to delivering the appropriate policy response. And the diagnosis, by and large, is this: monetary policy is working to build up reflationary pressures, but this process is being slowed by a combination of external price shocks, more slack in the labour market and a changing relationship between slack and inflation. The past period of low inflation is also perpetuating these dynamics. These effects, however, are on the whole temporary and should not cause inflation to deviate from its trend over the medium term, so long as monetary policy continues to maintain the solid anchoring of inflation expectations. Hence we can be confident that our policy is working and its full effects on inflation will gradually materialise. But for that, our policy needs to be persistent, and we need to be prudent in how we adjust its parameters to improving economic conditions. Monetary policy is effective in raising demand Understanding inflation dynamics requires us to divide up the inflation process into two legs: the effect of monetary policy on aggregate demand; and the effect of aggregate demand on inflation. All the evidence suggests that the first leg is working well. Though the euro area recovery started later than those in other advanced economies, we have now enjoyed 16 straight quarters of growth, with the dispersion of GDP and employment growth rates among countries falling to record low levels. If one looks at the percentage of all sectors in all euro area countries that currently have positive growth, the figure stood at 84% in the first quarter of 2017, well above its historical average of 74%. Around 6.4 million jobs have been created in the euro area since the recovery began. The role of monetary policy in this growth story is clear. Since mid-2014, our monetary policy stance has been determined by the combination of three instruments: first, low policy interest rates; second, asset purchases in financial markets and targeted long-term refinancing operations for banks; reinforced by, third, forward guidance on both. This has created strong downward pressure on financing costs, with rates falling steeply across asset classes, maturities and countries, as well as across different categories of borrowers. Converging financing conditions have in turn fed into rising domestic demand. According to our Bank Lending Survey, our latest easing phase has coincided with a strong rebound in demand for consumer credit to purchase durable goods, while demand for loans for fixed investment has gradually firmed. At the same time, falling borrowing costs have reduced interest payment burdens and facilitated deleveraging, which is one reason why, for virtually the first time since 1999, spending has been rising while indebtedness has been falling. This is a sign that the recovery may be becoming more sustainable. Just to put our measures into context, since January 2015 – that is, following the announcement of the expanded asset purchase programme (APP) – GDP has grown by 3.6% in the euro area. That is a higher growth rate than in same period following QE1 or QE2 in the United States, and a percentage point lower than the period after QE3. Employment in the euro area has also risen by more than four million since we announced the expanded APP, comparable with both QE2 and QE3 in the US, and considerably higher than QE1. For the monetary transmission process to work, however, stronger growth and employment ought to translate into higher capacity utilisation, scarcity in production factors and – in time – upward pressure on wages and prices. And this is what we see. The unemployment gap – the difference between actual unemployment and the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) – is narrowing and is forecast by the Commission to close within the next two years. Surveys of business capacity utilisation are now above their long-term average levels. And inflation is recovering. Between 2016 and 2019 we estimate that our monetary policy will have lifted inflation by 1.7 percentage points, cumulatively. Yet the second leg of the inflation process – the transmission from rising demand to rising inflation – has been more subdued than in the past. How can this be explained? The link between output and inflation is determined by three main factors: external shocks to prices; the size of the output gap and its impact on inflation; and the extent to which current inflation feeds into price and wage setting. In different ways, each of these factors has been relevant for the delayed reaction of inflation to the recovery. Temporary external shocks Starting with external factors, one explanation for the slow improvement in inflation dynamics is that we are still suffering the after-effects of price shocks in global energy and commodity markets, which have led output and inflation to move in different directions. Inflation has indeed been subject to such shocks over recent years, most notably the oil and commodity price collapse in 2014-15. This not only depressed the cost of imported energy, but also lowered global producer prices more generally. ECB analysis suggests that the global component in the underperformance of euro area inflation in recent years was considerable. In 2015-16, around two thirds of the deviation of euro area headline inflation from a model-based mean can be accounted for by global shocks linked to oil prices. Even though the downward pressure on inflation from past oil price falls is now waning, oil and commodity prices are still having a dragging effect – if only because they continue to lack a clear upward trend. In fact, lower oil and food prices than those assumed in the March 2017 projections are an important factor behind the downward revision of our latest inflation forecasts. Oil-related base effects are also the main driver of the considerable volatility in headline inflation that we have seen, and will be seeing, in the euro area. Falling import prices partly explain the subdued performance of core inflation, too. This is because imported consumer products account for around 15% of industrial goods in the euro area. Likewise, changes in commodity prices feed through into some services items and into industrial goods produced with high energy intensity. As a result, in the first quarter of 2017, oil-sensitive items were still holding back core inflation. This illustrates that core inflation does not always give us a clear reading of underlying inflation dynamics. Global factors therefore do appear to be weighing on the path of inflation today. But our analysis suggests that the drivers of low oil prices at present are mainly supply factors, which a central bank can typically look through.[1] And even if supply factors affect the path of inflation for some time, with inflation expectations secure, they should not ultimately affect the inflation trend. Uncertainty over slack and its impact on inflation A second explanation for the discrepancy between real developments and inflation is uncertainty surrounding the size of the output gap and its impact on inflation. This might be happening for a variety of reasons. One possible reason is that we are currently experiencing positive supply developments. In particular, we do observe that, as the recovery strengthens, the supply of labour is rising too. Labour force participation has been growing consistently over the last few years, buoyed especially by increases in participation rates of older workers. We also see some evidence that labour supply has become more elastic due to immigration, particularly in strongly growing economies such as Germany.[2] Since 2007, the euro area participation rate has risen by around 1.5 percentage points, whereas in the United States it has fallen by more than 3 percentage points in the same period.[3] Structural reforms in labour markets have been a factor in this labour supply boost. Similarly, past reforms in product markets may also have had a positive effect on the supply side by reducing price mark-ups, increasing productivity and raising growth potential. Another reason why there is some uncertainty over slack is the correct notion of unemployment – that is, there may be residual slack in the labour market that is not being fully captured in the headline unemployment measures. Unemployment in the euro area has risen during the crisis, but so too has the number of workers who are underemployed (meaning that they would like to work more hours) or who have temporary jobs and want permanent ones. This has implications for inflation dynamics, since these people might prioritise more hours or job security over higher wages in employment negotiations. If one uses a broader measure of labour market slack including the unemployed, underemployed and those marginally attached to the labour force – the so-called “U6” – that measure currently covers 18% of the euro area labour force.[4] Phillips curve models that employ this measure appear to be more successful in predicting inflation.[5] A third reason why slack might be larger is the effect of so-called “global slack”. This is the notion that globalisation has made labour supply characteristics more uniform across the globe and labour markets more contestable. Conditions in foreign labour markets could therefore have a dampening effect on domestic inflation even as domestic slack is shrinking. The evidence, however, is not clear-cut. For example, new ECB analysis finds only limited support for the thesis that global slack is weighing on euro area inflation today, over and above the impact it has on global prices.[6] Alongside the question of the level of slack is the impact of slack on inflation. This is the well-known debate on the slope of the Phillips curve. There are indeed reasons to believe that wage and price setting behaviour in the euro area might have changed during the crisis in ways that slow the responsiveness of inflation. For example, structural reforms that have increased firm-level wage bargaining may have made wages more flexible downwards but not necessarily upwards. Likewise, we see today that firms are absorbing input costs through lower margins due to uncertainty over future demand, which would also tend to temper price pressures. Indeed, ECB estimates show that, if we take into account the unusually large and persistent shocks of the past years, the Phillips curve for core inflation may well be somewhat flatter recently. However, insofar as the slope of the Phillips curve depends nonlinearly on the cyclical position, it may steepen again when the economy reaches and surpasses full potential. While these various reasons might delay the transmission of our monetary policy to prices, they will not prevent it. As the business cycle matures, the higher demand resulting from positive supply developments will accelerate price pressures, while firms’ pricing power will increase and the broader measures of slack will converge towards the headline measures. As shown in the United States, the gap between the headline unemployment rate and those broader measures typically opens in recessions and shrinks in expansions. Currently, it is converging to the minimum levels recorded before the 2001 and 2007 recessions. So just as for oil and commodity price shocks, we can be reasonably confident that the forces we see weighing on inflation are temporary – so long as they do not feed more lastingly into inflation dynamics. Low inflation feeding into price and wage setting This brings us to the third possible explanation for why growth might be diverging from inflation: the hypothesis that a persistent period of low inflation is in fact feeding into price and wage setting in a more persistent way. What is clear is that our monetary policy measures have been successful in avoiding a deflationary spiral and securing the anchoring of inflation expectations. In the past, as interest rates approached zero, some did question our ability to add sufficient accommodation to combat a prolonged period of too-low inflation. We answered those doubts by demonstrating that we would take any measures necessary within our mandate to deliver our mandate, and that those measures were effective in further easing financial conditions. Deflation risk premia, which had been growing in 2014 and 2015, have now been more or less priced out of market-based inflation expectations. That being said, a prolonged period of low inflation is always likely to be exacerbated by backward-lookingness in wage and price formation that occurs due to institutional factors, such as wage indexation. This has plainly happened in the euro area. ECB analysis finds that, compared with long-term averages, low past inflation dragged down wage growth by around 0.25 percentage points each year between 2014 and 2016. The evidence as to whether backward-lookingness has increased recently is mixed. There were signs that indexation had fallen in the early part of the crisis, and ECB empirical estimates suggest that the weight of past inflation in current inflation has decreased. Yet there is also evidence that indexation has returned in some large euro area countries. In Italy, for example, backward-looking indexation of wages now covers around one-third of private sector employees.[7] Still, even if indexation rose, it would only create inertia in price formation: it would not obstruct the transmission process. As economic slack shrinks, upward pressure on prices will materialise and gradually enter the indexation ratchet. So once again we see temporary forces at work that should not affect medium-term price stability. And this assessment is broadly what we see in market-based inflation expectations today. Interpreting with some caution, they are now consistent with the picture that our policy is effective, but that its full effects will take time to materialise. Accompanying the recovery So what do these various explanations imply for our monetary policy stance? The first point to make is that we face a very different situation today from the one we encountered three years ago. Then, we also faced global shocks and significant labour market slack. But the recovery was still in its infancy. Global growth was slowing, depressing both import prices and net exports. Fiscal policy was less supportive than it is now. And headline inflation was much lower than today and inflation expectations more fragile, creating a higher risk of low inflation becoming entrenched. In this context we faced another risk, too: of permanent damage to the economy through so-called “hysteresis effects”. Given the large degree of slack at the time, the risk was that if output remained below potential for too long, we would see a permanent destruction of productive capacity. The output gap would close the “wrong way” making the losses permanent. When we said we wanted our policy to have effects without undue delay, we meant we wanted the output gap to close “upwards” – and before such hysteresis effects could develop. This is why we had to act forcefully.[8] Now, we can be confident that our policy is working and that those risks have abated. The threat of deflation is gone and reflationary forces are at play. And since one of the drivers of inflation today is positive supply developments, this should feed back positively into potential output rather than produce hysteresis. In these conditions, we can be more assured about the return of inflation to our objective than we were a few years ago. This more favourable balance of risks has been already reflected in our monetary policy stance, via the adjustments we have made to our forward guidance. Another considerable change from three years ago is the clarification of the political outlook in the euro area. For years, the euro area has lived under a cloud of uncertainty about whether the necessary reforms would be implemented at both the domestic and Union levels. This acted as a brake on confidence and investment, which is tantamount to an implicit tightening of economic conditions. Today, things have changed. Political winds are becoming tailwinds. There is newfound confidence in the reform process, and newfound support for European cohesion, which could help unleash pent-up demand and investment. Nevertheless, we are still in a situation of continuing slack, and where a long period of subpar inflation translates into a slower return of inflation to our objective. Inflation dynamics are not yet durable and self-sustaining. So our monetary policy needs to be persistent. This is why the Governing Council has repeatedly emphasised that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up, and to support headline inflation in the medium term. This is reflected in our forward guidance on net asset purchases and interest rates, as well as our decision to reinvest the principal payments received under the APP for as long as necessary. With reflationary dynamics slowly taking hold, we now need to ensure that overall financing conditions continue to support that reflationary process, until they are more durable and self-sustaining. As the economy continues to recover, a constant policy stance will become more accommodative, and the central bank can accompany the recovery by adjusting the parameters of its policy instruments – not in order to tighten the policy stance, but to keep it broadly unchanged. But there is an important caveat that we need to consider. Financing conditions are not only determined by the calibration of central bank instruments, but also by other market prices, some of which are significantly affected by global developments. In the past, especially in times of global uncertainty, volatility in financial market prices has at times caused an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions, which has necessitated a monetary policy response. So in the current context where global uncertainties remain elevated, there are strong grounds for prudence in the adjustment of monetary policy parameters, even when accompanying the recovery. Any adjustments to our stance have to be made gradually, and only when the improving dynamics that justify them appear sufficiently secure. Conclusion Let me conclude. Our assessment of the outlook for inflation and for monetary policy can be summed up in three messages. The first is confidence that monetary policy is effective and the transmission process will work. All the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area. Deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones. While there are still factors that are weighing on the path of inflation, at present they are mainly temporary factors that typically the central bank can look through. However, a considerable degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for inflation dynamics to become durable and self-sustaining. So for us to be assured about the return of inflation to our objective, we need persistence in our monetary policy. And, finally, we need prudence. As the economy picks up we will need to be gradual when adjusting our policy parameters, so as to ensure that our stimulus accompanies the recovery amid the lingering uncertainties.

Lane,,all_ECB_speeches.csv,"SPEECH Disinflation and monetary policy in the euro area Dinner speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Money Marketeers of New York University New York, 21 September 2023 Introduction In my remarks this evening, I will assess the economic and inflation outlook in the euro area and explain last week’s monetary policy decision taken by the Governing Council of the ECB. Before I turn to the most recent developments, let me start by recalling how we got to where we are today.[1] The 2021-2022 inflation surge in Europe was driven predominantly by an extraordinary combination of shocks. The pandemic generated a staggered sequence of sectoral supply-demand mismatches. Especially in 2021, the global rotation of spending from services towards goods — at a time when supply remained hampered by pandemic-related lockdowns — resulted in severe supply chain bottlenecks and fostered exceptional pricing power for producers of in-demand products. In Europe, after alternating waves of lockdowns and temporary reopenings, the economy fully reopened in the spring of 2022 at a time when the supply capacity in contact-intensive service sectors (especially the tourism and hospitability sectors) had not yet recovered from the prolonged shutdown phase. In parallel, the unjustified invasion of Ukraine by Russia triggered an extraordinary surge in energy prices (and attendant terms of trade losses) that peaked in August 2022. The scale and breadth of these shocks generated extraordinary shifts in sectoral relative prices. In principle, fluctuations in sectoral relative prices can be accommodated with no change in the overall inflation rate. However, in the presence of downward price rigidities and downward wage stickiness, this would have required an enormous tightening of monetary policy and depression of output. Together with the inevitable time lags in monetary policy transmission, this is the fundamental reason why central banks focus on medium-term inflation rather than seeking to deliver the inflation target continuously. In the euro area, inflation peaked at 10.6 per cent in October 2022. The peak inflation rate would have been even higher in the absence of the significant fiscal subsidies rolled out by euro area governments in the final months of 2022. During 2023 many of these factors have reversed: energy prices have come down sharply from their peaks; supply conditions in global manufacturing and global trade have normalised; and demand-supply mismatches in contact-intensive sectors have moderated. Inflation Inflation in August stood at 5.2 per cent, meaning that about 60 per cent of the peak gap to our inflation target has faded away. Our latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections foresee inflation standing at 3.3 per cent in the final quarter of this year. While the lifting of fiscal subsidies means that inflation will only decline to a limited extent during 2024, to 2.9 per cent in the final quarter, it is projected that inflation will return to our two per cent target by the third quarter of 2025. Within this overall trend, the nature of inflation is shifting. While external and pandemic-related factors have played a dominant role in the initial inflation surge and the partial fallback that has occurred this year, the full dynamic adjustment to these shocks involves a staggered reset of prices and wages across the economy, a process which is ongoing. Given the episodic nature of wage adjustment and the variety of institutional arrangements across the member countries, this is inevitably a multi-year process. I will return to this topic later. The inflation outlook remains subject to considerable uncertainty. On one side, upside risks to inflation include potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food. Adverse weather conditions, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could push food prices up by more than expected. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. On the other side, weaker demand – for example owing to a stronger transmission of monetary policy or a worsening of the external environment – would lead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term. Economic activity In terms of activity levels, output in the euro area broadly stagnated over the first half of this year. Manufacturing output is set to remain weak in view of further moderation in export demand and tight financing conditions, while past support from order backlogs is declining. Services have so far contributed positively to growth, due to the higher demand in contact-intensive sectors, but there have been clear signs of a slowdown since June. In the near term, private consumption is expected to remain weak, while housing and business investment are seen as declining further, also driven by the monetary policy tightening. Over time, the economic momentum should pick up as real incomes are expected to rise, supported by falling inflation, rising wages and a strong labour market, which will underpin consumer spending. However, activity levels will be dampened as the policy tightening and adverse credit supply conditions increasingly feed through to the real economy. The expected gradual withdrawal of fiscal support is also likely to weigh on economic growth in the coming quarters. The labour market has so far remained resilient despite the slowing economy but shows signs of losing momentum. The unemployment rate remained at its historical low of 6.4 per cent in July. While employment grew by 0.2 per cent in the second quarter, the latest survey data on employment growth came close to stalling. This indicates that employers have become more reluctant to hire in the face of deteriorating demand and gloomier prospects for the year ahead. In addition, strong labour demand has begun to moderate, with indicators of job vacancy rates edging down in recent months. These developments are reflected in significant downward revisions for output growth in the September staff projections: annual average output growth is now projected at 0.7 per cent in 2023, 1.0 per cent in 2024 and 1.5 per cent in 2025. In terms of the quarterly profile, most of the markdown in activity is for 2023, with carry-over effects from this year accounting for much of the downward revision to the 2024 growth outlook. The risks to economic growth are tilted to the downside. Economic growth could be slower if the effects of monetary policy are more forceful than expected or if the world economy weakens owing, for instance, to a further slowdown in China. That said, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty mean that people and businesses become more confident and spend more. Monetary policy transmission Turning to our monetary policy, we have raised our policy rate by a cumulative 450 basis points over the last ten Governing Council meetings. The reimbursements of the third series of our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) that have taken place so far and the slowdown and subsequent discontinuation of reinvestments under the asset purchase programme (APP) have reduced our balance sheet by €1.6 trillion and €109 billion respectively. By pushing up term premia and draining liquidity from the banking system, these ancillary policies are also contributing to the tightening in financing conditions, even if rate increases are the primary tool for adjusting our monetary policy stance. The global tightening of monetary policy is further adding to disinflationary pressure through an array of international trade and financial spillovers. Our monetary policy tightening continues to be transmitted strongly to financing conditions and is increasingly affecting the broader economy.[2] The pass-through to bank funding costs has proceeded rapidly, most notably for yields on bank bonds. In addition to the impact of the policy rate hikes, the phasing out of the ECB’s TLTRO III has also raised bank funding costs. After an initial sluggish response, transmission to the remuneration of time deposits has been particularly strong in the euro area. High bank funding costs have passed through into a strong increase in lending rates to non-financial corporations and a tightening of credit standards, while loan volumes in the euro area have weakened sharply since the end of 2022. Looking at the most recent data, lending rates for new business have further increased and credit volumes are continuing to contract. In particular, lending to firms and households is weak, amid higher bank funding costs and a tightening of credit standards. Substantial tightening is still expected to pass through in the coming months, as more fixed-rate loans expire and banks face rising funding costs as more savers migrate to term deposits and high-yield bank bonds. In line with the decrease in credit creation, the growth rate of M3 turned negative in July for the first time since 2010 and is expected to decline further to more negative levels in the coming months. It is important to appreciate that the strong transmission of monetary policy tightening during this hiking cycle has not been at the cost of weakening the banking system. In particular, banks are currently benefiting from solid capital positions, resilient net interest income and contained credit risks. In turn, the robust state of the banking system can be linked to the relatively strong balance sheets of the household and corporate sectors, which were boosted by high savings rates and considerable fiscal transfers during the pandemic. Of course, close monitoring of the financial stability implications of our monetary policy continues to be an integral component in our policy-making process. Last week’s interest rate decision Based on our assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, we raised the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at last week’s policy meeting in order to reinforce progress towards our two per cent medium-term inflation target. In particular, the deposit facility rate, which under conditions of ample liquidity is the policy rate that determines money market conditions, now stands at 4 per cent (400 basis points). In explaining this decision, the incoming data have largely validated our previous assessment of the inflation outlook, while most measures of underlying inflation have started to ease. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that the transmission of our monetary policy to broader financing conditions and the real economy is firmly taking hold. The economic slowdown since the middle of 2022 is set to continue in the near term and the level of GDP will be considerably lower than we had previously expected. The resulting additional slack will further contribute to the disinflation process, while a significant portion of the tightening from our past rate hikes is still in the pipeline. Drawing on the baseline staff projections, a range of model-based simulations suggest that a deposit facility rate of 400 basis points, so long as it is understood to be maintained for a sufficiently long duration, should be consistent with a return of inflation to target within the projection horizon. The views of external experts in our latest Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) were also clustered in the (375,400) interval in terms of a peak policy rate. This path for policy rates is also broadly reflected in market pricing of the forward rate curve. In view of the uncertainty surrounding future inflation dynamics and the conditional, point-in-time nature of model-based simulations, expert surveys and market indicators, the choice between holding at 375 and moving to 400 was finely balanced. However, at the margin, it is safer to have decided on an additional hike rather than pause at 375 and “wait and see” whether an additional hike would be validated by the data flow between now and future meetings. In particular, the decision was motivated by the highly uncertain environment and the significant disinflation that is still required to return to our target in a timely manner. The additional rate hike will reinforce progress towards our target for two basic reasons. First, if the economy evolves according to the staff projections baseline case, last week’s decision to hike bolsters confidence that inflation will return to target within the projection horizon. Second, a higher level of the interest rate will more strongly limit the amplification of any upside shocks to the inflation path, in view of the interaction dynamics between inflation shocks and the overall demand environment. It follows that, all else being equal, a more secure pace of disinflation and greater insurance against upside risks will also reinforce the anchoring of inflation expectations, which remains a precondition for the disinflation process to keep up its pace. Looking ahead With last week’s decision, the key policy rates have been raised by a cumulative 450 basis points over the last ten meetings. Based on our current assessment (and cross-checked with external perspectives), our key policy rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to our target. Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. At the same time, the high level of two-sided uncertainty around the baseline means that we will remain data dependent in determining the appropriate level and duration of restrictiveness in our monetary stance. In assessing the inflation data over the coming months, base effects will play a significant role, making it unusually challenging to extract the underlying component from the reported data. In one direction, the very high energy-related price increases that occurred last Autumn will fall out of the annual inflation calculation, delivering declines in both headline and core inflation measures. In the other direction, many fiscal subsidies are scheduled to expire, which will raise reported inflation rates, especially in relation to 2024. The ongoing volatility in energy and food prices also adds to the noise-to-signal ratio in the inflation data, especially in view of the high uncertainty about the persistence and propagation of such shocks in the current environment. The noise-to-signal ratio is further elevated due to the lower reliability of standard seasonal adjustment techniques under current conditions. Furthermore, standard indicators of underlying inflation require adjustments to strip out the impact of energy costs and supply bottlenecks on economy-wide prices, while the temporary contribution of pandemic reopening effects on the prices of contact-intensive services also distorts these indicators.[3] Among the main open questions that the incoming data will need to answer will be the dynamics of wages and profits in the coming quarters. In particular, the disinflation embedded in the staff projections is built on a deceleration in wage growth, with the rate of increase in compensation per employee dropping from 5.3 per cent in 2023 to 4.3 per cent in 2024 and 3.8 per cent in 2025. These projected rates of wage increases are sufficient to restore the pre-pandemic level of real wages within the projection horizon, with the rates of wage inflation in 2024 and 2025 well ahead of the rates of price inflation. It will be well into the new year before the area-wide 2024 wage trends become fully visible: this fundamental source of uncertainty will not be resolved any time soon. In turn, the next phase in wage adjustment will also depend on the extent to which labour demand is affected by the slowdown in economic activity. In particular, the dampening of activity levels and the increase in financing costs might lower the propensity to hoard labour. The contribution of unit profits to annual inflation in the first half of 2023 has moderated relative to its contribution in 2022, suggesting that the rising wage pressures are starting to be absorbed by firms. Price hikes coming in below the increase in unit labour costs are projected to contribute further to the required disinflation during 2024. In parallel to the drawn-out nature of the wage adjustment process, the actual contribution of profit moderation to disinflation will only be uncovered over a number of quarters. In terms of the policy response, our restrictive monetary policy stance is providing considerable support to the required disinflation dynamics. In particular, the stagnation of activity levels during 2023 and the associated higher level of slack in the economy means that firms will be more cautious in seeking outsized price hikes and more reluctant to grant excessive wage increases. In related fashion, any new cost-push shocks are less likely to be amplified under demand-constrained conditions, with such shocks more likely to dent the real value of both profits and wages, rather than being fully passed through to consumer prices. At the same time, we will continue to monitor the strength of monetary policy transmission, in view of the state-contingent impact of monetary policy tightening on financing conditions, the real economy and inflation dynamics. These considerations suggest that we still have ahead of us an extended phase of uncertainty about the disinflation process. Given the scale of the initial inflation shock, the lagged nature of wage adjustment in the euro area, the considerable sectoral rebalancing that is underway and the extent of uncertainty about transmission lags and the strength of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, it is hardly surprising that inflation uncertainty will not be quickly resolved.

We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. The Governing Council therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. The rate increase today reflects our assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The developments since our last meeting support our expectation that inflation will drop further over the remainder of the year but will stay above target for an extended period. While some measures show signs of easing, underlying inflation remains high overall. Our past rate increases continue to be transmitted forcefully: financing conditions have tightened again and are increasingly dampening demand, which is an important factor in bringing inflation back to target.Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.We also decided to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at zero per cent. This decision will preserve the effectiveness of monetary policy by maintaining the current degree of control over the monetary policy stance and ensuring the full pass-through of our interest rate decisions to money markets. At the same time, it will improve the efficiency of monetary policy by reducing the overall amount of interest that needs to be paid on reserves in order to implement the appropriate stance.The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website. The details of the change to the remuneration of minimum reserves are provided in a separate press release to be published at 15:45 CET.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityThe near-term economic outlook for the euro area has deteriorated, owing largely to weaker domestic demand. High inflation and tighter financing conditions are dampening spending. This is weighing especially on manufacturing output, which is also being held down by weak external demand. Housing and business investment are showing signs of weakness as well. Services remain more resilient, especially in contact-intensive subsectors such as tourism. But momentum is slowing in the services sector. The economy is expected to remain weak in the short run. Over time, falling inflation, rising incomes and improving supply conditions should support the recovery.The labour market remains robust. The unemployment rate stayed at its historical low of 6.5 per cent in May and many new jobs are being created, especially in the services sector. At the same time, forward-looking indicators suggest that this trend might slow down in the coming months and may turn negative for manufacturing.As the energy crisis fades, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and in a concerted manner. This is essential to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would otherwise call for a stronger monetary policy response. We welcome the recent Eurogroup statement on the euro area fiscal stance, which is consistent with this assessment. Fiscal policies should be designed to make our economy more productive and to gradually bring down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity can help reduce price pressures in the medium term, while supporting the green transition, which is also being furthered by the Next Generation EU programme. The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded before the end of this year. InflationInflation came down further in June, reaching 5.5 per cent, after 6.1 per cent in May. Energy prices fell again, dropping by 5.6 per cent, year on year. Food price inflation continued to slow but remained high, at 11.6 per cent. Inflation excluding energy and food edged up to 5.5 per cent in June, with goods and services following diverging trends. Goods inflation decreased further, to 5.5 per cent, from 5.8 per cent in May. Conversely, services inflation rose to 5.4 per cent, from 5.0 per cent in May, owing to robust spending on holidays and travel and also reflecting upward base effects. The drivers of inflation are changing. External sources of inflation are easing. By contrast, domestic price pressures, including from rising wages and still robust profit margins, are becoming an increasingly important driver of inflation. While some measures are moving lower, underlying inflation remains high overall, including owing to the persistent impact of past energy price increases on economy-wide prices. Although most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2 per cent, some indicators remain elevated and need to be monitored closely.Risk assessment The outlook for economic growth and inflation remains highly uncertain. Downside risks to growth include Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and an increase in broader geopolitical tensions, which could fragment global trade and thus weigh on the euro area economy. Growth could also be slower if the effects of monetary policy are more forceful than expected, or if the world economy weakens and thereby dampens demand for euro area exports. Conversely, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty mean that people and businesses become more confident and spend more.Upside risks to inflation include potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food, also related to Russia’s unilateral withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Adverse weather conditions, in light of the unfolding climate crisis, may push up food prices by more than projected. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. By contrast, weaker demand – for example owing to a stronger transmission of monetary policy – would lead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term. Moreover, inflation would come down faster if declining energy prices and lower food price increases were to pass through to the prices of other goods and services more quickly than currently anticipated.Financial and monetary conditionsOur monetary policy tightening continues to be transmitted strongly to broader financing conditions. Risk-free interest rates over short to medium-term maturities have increased since our last meeting and funding has become more expensive for banks, in part owing to the ongoing phasing-out of the ECB’s targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). The large TLTRO repayment in June went smoothly, as banks were well prepared. Average lending rates for business loans and mortgages rose again in May, to 4.6 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively. Higher borrowing rates and the associated cuts in spending plans led to a further sharp drop in credit demand in the second quarter, as reported in our latest bank lending survey. Moreover, credit standards for loans to firms and households tightened further, as banks are becoming more concerned about the risks faced by their customers and are less willing to bear these risks. Tighter financing conditions are also making housing less affordable and less attractive as an investment, and demand for mortgages has dropped for the fifth quarter in a row.Against this background, the annual growth rate of lending continued to decrease in June, falling to 3.0 per cent for firms and 1.7 per cent for households, with annualised growth rates of 0.0 per cent and -0.2 per cent in the second quarter respectively. Amid weak lending and the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet, the annual growth rate of broad money fell to 0.6 per cent in June, with an annualised growth rate of -1.1 per cent in the second quarter.Conclusion Inflation continues to decline but is still expected to remain too high for too long. The Governing Council therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points.Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *Does the absence of guidance for September mean the Governing Council is equally open to another hike, to a pause or even to the conclusion that rates have already reached their peak? That would be the first. And the second one – I am wondering how much of your decision on lowering the remuneration of minimum reserves was driven by concerns over central bank losses. Let me just remind you what we have been doing. And I will come to your interest, which is what happens next. But let me just remind you what we are doing, and what we have been doing. We are raising interest rates, all three rates by 25 basis points. And this is the ninth decision to hike that has been taken in a matter of one year. So invariably, on meeting after the other, we have raised rates. The DFR is now at 3.75. And this decision that was unanimously agreed amongst all members of the Governing Council is driven by one key determination, which is to bring inflation to target, our target, which is medium-term inflation. There is unanimous determination to do so. What we have decided as well, and I will come to your minimum reserves remuneration as well, because that was your second question. We have also decided, and I’m going to quote, because it is a sentence that you might hear over and over, not only this time, but also next time and future times. We say “our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target. So, some of you may have noticed a slight change of a verb. And that is not just random or irrelevant. And I think it is predicated on our determination to be data dependent. So, I have said on many occasions that we had ground to cover or that we have more ground to cover. What I am saying here is that data and our assessment of data will actually tell us whether and how much ground we have to cover. So we are deliberately data-dependent and we have an open mind as to what the decisions will be in September and in subsequent meetings. Because this determination based on data might vary from one month to the other. So we might hike and we might hold, and what is decided in September is not definitive. It may vary from one meeting to the other. So I hope it is very clear that we are not in the domain of forward guidance but we are very strongly rooted in our determination to break the back of inflation and to take inflation back to 2% in the medium term on a sustainable basis. And to do that, we will be informed by data, we will analyse the data and we will then decide at that point in time. We will have the inflation outlook, we will have two readings of inflation with all the underlying dissection and understanding of it. And we will have even more understanding of our monetary policy transmission. And that will be repeated every Governing Council after every Governing Council, so that we can make sure as I said that we break the back of inflation.Now, on your second question. Our primary job is to set monetary policy so that inflation stabilises at 2% over the medium term. No dispute about that. But we also have a public duty to make the implementation of our monetary policy as efficient as possible. So by cutting the remuneration on minimum reserves only, that’s the basis that we will use. Cutting it to zero, we will reduce the amount of interest that we pay, which means the implementation of our policy is going to be more efficient. At the same time, it is going to have no impact on our policy stance, which is currently determined by the remuneration not on minimum reserves, but on excess reserves, which as you know are far more plentiful than the minimum reserves. So that is the decision that we made. More efficiency and that’s also of course predicated on the principle of proportionality.I have a question on the discussion concerning the time lag of monetary policy decisions and the effect it will have on inflation, because you have of course tightened at a record pace now and there are discussions that one first has to wait a little bit to really see the materialisation of those rate hikes. So, how are discussions going on that front? And then I would like to know whether you have discussed accelerating the shrinking of your balance sheet and if not, whether this could be a topic for the so-called second half of the year. Thank you very much for your two questions. I’ll take the second one. We have not discussed the reduction of our balance sheet and we have obviously acknowledged that the balance sheet has been reduced. And it has been reduced as a result of, number one, the reimbursement of more than what was expected to be reimbursed under the TLTRO reimbursement in June, and also by the fact that we have not only stopped net asset purchases but we have stopped any reinvestments. So, the balance sheet of the ECB is reducing as a result of that. But we have not discussed any further reduction at this point. On your other question, as you know, transmission of monetary policy is one of the three metrics that we use in order to determine our monetary policy stance, the strength of monetary policy transmission. And we look at it that way. We see it essentially as a two-legged process. The first leg is transmission to financing at large. What is the impact on lending, lending for banks, lending by banks to both corporates and households? And we try to measure that as accurately as possible by looking at volumes of loans, by looking at rates, by looking at obviously the bank lending survey that many of you have commented on yesterday, which informs us about what banks anticipate and in which areas, in which directions they expect to either increase or reduce the volumes of loans and reassess their risks in relation to borrowers. So that’s the first leg and there are clear indications that our monetary policy is transmitted though that channel. The next one, which is the second leg, is transmission to the economy and from financing to the economy. How quickly does that move, how efficient is it. And we are really now beginning to see transmission materialising, whether you look at investment in housing, whether you look at investment altogether, there is obviously a decline on those two accounts. Still too early and there is certainly more in the pipeline, but we are definitely seeing monetary policy being transmitted and being transmitted strongly. That’s obviously the case for the first leg and it is now also beginning to be the case in the second one.So at the last meeting, you said you were not even thinking about pausing. Would you repeat that today? The second question is would you agree with the line that has been repeated by many of your colleagues in the Governing Council that the risks of doing too little outweigh the risks of doing too much in terms of rate hikes?You will have to understand something, which is that I am not repeating things if prompted. I decide to say what I want to say. Okay. So what I just said in response to the first question. I hope it was clear. But I just want to repeat it for you just to make sure that I am as clear as you would expect. We are moving to a stage where we are going to be data-dependent, and we will take the new projection by staff. We are going to take two new readings. We are going to take more information about how transmission has taken place and on the basis of that, we will determine whether we hike or whether we pause. But what I can assure you of is that we are not going to cut, that is a definite no! But on the other side, it could be hike, it could be a pause. And if it is a pause, it would not necessarily be for an extended period of time, because as I said, it will vary from meeting to meeting, because we continue to decide on a meeting by meeting basis every time informed by the data. I hope it is as clear as I can be, because we are, and that was absolutely endorsed by the Governing Council, which has validated this decision unanimously, determined to operate on that basis. Voilà! Your second question, I have forgotten. You always ask something that I should repeat or that I should endorse but I am not doing that, sorry. You know, if my colleagues take this view or another, that’s fine. And they can certainly be free to expand in one way or another. But I can assure you that on the occasion of today, it was a unanimous determination. The determination is rooted in one very simply direction: 2%. We want to break the back of inflation. 2% is the goal and we will get there, come what may.I have two questions. Actually one is on financial stability. Do you consider European commercial real estate as a matter of concern? And the second one, can you elaborate more in detail about the spiral between wages and prices and inflation?De Guindos: Good afternoon. With respect to commercial real estate, it is quite clear if you look at our financial stability review that we have paid a lot of attention to commercial property and to the decline in prices. This decline in prices started even before the tightening of monetary policy. And you know, the different agents and players that are exposed to commercial property market are mainly non-banks. So it is something that we pay attention to, that we have analysed in the past. And there is a clear divide between commercial and residential property. In the case of residential property, we have not seen any decline in prices but what we have seen is a slowdown in the evolution of prices. But commercial property is something that we have paid attention to and will continue to pay attention to in the future.Lagarde: And on your second question, I think you raised the question of the potential risk of second round effects. Let me just take you back for a second, because it is a matter that we have reviewed, that staff are doing a lot of work on and that we have discussed. It is the role of wage growth and the role of profit margins as two key drivers of inflation, which are gradually eliminating the external causes that were prevalent before. The wage increases are definitely playing an increasing role as a driver of inflation and so have profit margins. On the profit margins front, we are seeing a slight decline in the first quarter of 2023 and as you may remember, our projection is also predicated on the fact that profit margins are wide enough to accommodate the squeeze that will be needed in order to allow for wage increases. But if we look at inflation expectations, if we look at how wages and profit margins are evolving, we are not seeing a second-round effect and for the moment at least, nothing suggests the risk of strengthening any second-round effects. But we are really monitoring that very carefully because, as you know, service inflation is the sort of hard nut to crack in terms of inflation, given that on goods it’s going down, energy is coming out and it’s negative. Clearly, we are focusing on services that are labour-intensive and that are also not as sensitive to interest rates. But we are looking at that very carefully and will continue to look at that extremely carefully.Regarding the September meeting and the possibility of hiking or pausing, as of today, does the burden of the proof fall on an improvement of the inflation outlook, or will it be enough if the situation does not worsen? And a second question if I may: Spanish headline inflation is now in line with the mandate and the labour market is as hot as it has been for more than a decade. Is it something you would like to see for the full eurozone or is it necessary for the unemployment rate to go up for the ECB to stop hiking? Do you mind me asking you to repeat what you said about the unemployment rate in Spain.It’s at the lowest point for more than a decade.Including for young people?Yes, I was just saying that would you like to see that for the whole euro zone? I mean inflation going to 2% and unemployment being low. Or is it just not possible and the labour market has to cool down?I’ll start with that one, your question about Spain, because it demonstrates the beauty of Europe and the heterogeneity that we have among the 20 countries that are members of the euro area. Obviously, the numbers that we see now for Spain, with inflation trending towards 2% and hopefully sustainably so, plus unemployment numbers that are as low as they have ever been, is a good set of numbers for the country and for the economy at large. It is not the same for all Member States and there are Member States where inflation is still very high and has been high and is expected to remain high for longer. So we have to be very attentive to the aggregate numbers. Those are the ones that are driving our inflation outlook, helping us determine our policy. But we also have to look at each Member State and the characteristics of each Member State. We shall see. Data will actually inform us better. But the hope that we have is that inflation will come down to 2% in the medium term. That is our primary mandate. As you know, we don’t have a dual mandate, unlike the Fed.That’s what going to drive our determination. If we can do that with unemployment at the lowest level and staying there, that could be very good. It’s funny because you ask the question of a lawyer. The issue of the burden of proof is very often a lawyer’s issue. I think the burden of proof is going to be on the data. Because we are determined to bring inflation back to target, but we are also going to be in the hands of data and the assessment of data. So the burden of proof is going to be on data.Two questions for you. First of all, how much do you think tighter monetary policy is contributing to the weakness in the euro zone economy that you identified? And secondly, what would it take in terms of reduction in your growth forecast and a reduction in your inflation forecast in September for you to pause interest rate rises?What we are working on and what staff is trying to be as detail-specific and conclusive about is the impact of our monetary policy on inflation. So this is really what is the focus and what is driving us. What impact our interest rate hikes have produced, produce, and will produce on inflation. And obviously, the exercise of producing the inflation outlook that will be conducted in September by ECB staff will be very informative for the Governing Council to determine how much has been transmitted and what is expected to continue to be transmitted. As I said earlier on, in the financing leg, a lot has been transmitted. A lot. We know that. In the economy at large, not as much yet. And your second question is totally hypothetical, and I understand why you would want me to answer that question. But there are so many data and so much to take on in terms of the projection that will be produced in September, that I cannot answer your question in advance. We will really have to see.You are suggesting a possible pause in rates in the near future. Does this mean that during this period of possible pause, we could see an acceleration of the QT. And then it would be like a trade-off among doves and hawks at the Governing Council?Our key tool, our key instrument in the current circumstances, given the level of inflation that we have at the moment, is interest rates. So there will be no trade-off between either interest rates or QT. Interest rates are the main tool and the most efficient one. So it is the one that we will be using. There is the possibility of a hike, there is the possibility of a pause. It’s a decisive maybe. But don’t expect me to go one way or the other. As I said, the burden of proof is going to be the data and the ultimate point that we are determined to reach is the 2% inflation.You’ve mentioned that several economic indicators recently have been weaker than expected and there are some economists warning already that the ECB is overdoing it with rate hikes, and they think that more patience would be necessary. So what’s your response to that? And my second question. Climate activists criticize that the green bond purchases by the ECB under the new scoring system have largely stopped. Have you perhaps promised too much in terms of what the ECB can contribute to climate protection?So we would be doing too much and promising too much. Look, doing too much is certainly not something that we are considering. What we are focusing on is the inflation numbers. We are committed to delivering 2% headline, medium term, on a sustainable basis, in a timely manner. This is our commitment. This is the drive of the Governing Council. When I look at headline numbers, when I look at core inflation numbers, when I look at all the many measures of underlying inflation, trying to really isolate the most robust element, and removing the most volatile part of it, we are seeing inflation that is still too high and that we project to remain too high for too long. So we have to do what we have to do, which is currently to hike. We know that we are getting closer, but we also know the options that are on the table: to continue to hike or to hold. And we also know that it will vary meeting by meeting because we want to be determined by the data and the analysis, and the assessment we make of the data. It’s not surprising that it is transmitting to the financing channel. It is not surprising that there is less investment in housing. It is not surprising that there is less investment altogether. This is the intended impact of the monetary policy stance that we have determined. And this is precisely what will return inflation to target. On the other point: have we promised too much? We have promised in our strategy review and subsequent decision, we have promised to be Paris Agreement-aligned. And obviously, as noted by all of you and as noticed by Greenpeace as well, we stopped any asset purchases under the Asset Purchase Programme, because we are no longer reinvesting. So as a result of that under the CSPP, we are not reinvesting. We are letting that portfolio into run-off mode. What we have decided is that we will stick to our commitment to be Paris Agreement-aligned, and we will in the course of 2023 elaborate the means and the ways by which we will be Paris-aligned. I just want to remind you, and this is not just to distract me for a second from the fight against inflation, but I just want to call your attention to the massive amount of work that is being done in the supervision arm of the ECB in order to really raise the level of awareness and the level of concern by banks and through banks by their clients. This is really beginning to work.You say that the burden of proof is in the data for future decisions. What data is it that gives you more confidence that you may be able to pause and what data would you be looking at especially over the next months, that would stop those rate hikes? Is it core inflation, is it more that you are looking at the downturn in the euro zone economy and concerns about that? And my second question is about the US and the comparison with the euro zone. The US has raised rates significantly more than the ECB for a similar core inflation rate, or even the euro zone core inflation rate is slightly higher. The IMF, your former employer, said this week that the ECB might have more ground to cover, do you agree? Do you think that there is a suggestion that there might be more work to do in raising rates? What data will be important? All data. And obviously we will be looking at all inflation data, starting with headline, we will have two readings before our September monetary policy Governing Council. We will look at core inflation, but we will go deeper into underlying inflation numbers to really appreciate and understand what is moving and what is steadily, sustainably moving. We know that some indicators are showing, particularly in goods, it’s pretty obvious, you look at producer prices, it’s pretty obvious. But when you start looking into services in particular, you have to really dissect those that are energy intensive, those that are interest sensitive, what share of labour there is in various segments of services. So we have to look into all that to understand whether the action that we have determined in the last year-and-a-half now, is really having a long-standing impact that will take inflation back to 2%. Don’t forget also that we will be looking at the inflation outlook that will be produced by the ECB, which will give us again the expected path of inflation, and the readings for 2024 and 2025 will obviously be very informative for us. We will look at labour numbers, we will look at investment numbers, we will look at just every single parameter of the whole economy of the euro area that we can look at in order to inform ourselves. I know it would be helpful for those who are using the same models, that are playing the same exercise, to understand from us that there is one particular specific indicator, one particular set of data that prevails over the others. No, it is not the case. We are looking at all of it and expectations are part of the picture as well. The institution that I used to lead, the IMF, has updated its real April numbers and I don’t think that any of its terribly talented staff would argue with me that inflation in the United States and inflation in Europe are two different beasts, that are fueled by different drivers and in a context that is vastly different, both in terms of fiscal, in terms of labour market, in terms of energy and that certainly has something to do with explaining why figures are where they are. You know that better than anyone else, the Fed started a little bit earlier than the ECB and started from a base that was not negative interest rates either. You asked, do we have more ground to cover. At this point in time, I wouldn’t say so because as I said, the data we just discussed, and the assessment of data, will actually tell us whether and how much ground we have to cover in September and at subsequent meetings. And as I said in the early part of this press conference, it may vary from one month to the other.I have two questions. One is on this message that you are conveying of the next meeting, that it could be a hike or a pause. The next meetings.And so compared to what we had up to now, that is a 25 basis points hike, coming to the next meeting, well, do you have a message to the European citizens that in the fight against inflation, you are getting closer to break the back of inflation? There is some good news in this announcement or these comments that you are making. And then the second question for me is on your assessment of the ECB euro area bank lending survey because it had some data on demand that was, I think, never seen in the past 20 years and so whether it was discussed at the Governing Council and it had an impact also on today’s decision?Yes, we are making progress. And I think the good news for European compatriots is that inflation is declining. You know we had a reading of 10.6% in October, we are now at 5.5%. But is that enough? Is that good as a result? Not quite. We have a target which is medium term 2% sustainable and we want to get there. But I’m sure that people when they do their shopping, when they fill up their tank, when they pay the gas bill, they see that the increase is not quite the same as six, seven months ago. Are we satisfied? Are we claiming victory? No, we want to go to the end of the game. The bank lending survey, yes, we looked at it carefully, it was debated with governors. And if you look at the monetary policy statement in the last paragraph that we have, it’s very significantly described. The annual growth rate of lending continued to decrease in June falling to 3% for firms and 1.7% for households, with annualised growth rate of 0%, completely flat, and -0.2% in the second quarter, respectively. So not only are we seeing it very mildly grow year on year, but we are seeing a decline in the last quarter and the same holds for both corporates and households. So yes, of course, this is one of the elements of transmission that we have seen discussed and the fall in demand is also obvious, particularly on the part of corporates. A bit less so for households, but on the part of corporates, absolutely, absolutely yes.",0.0529487168541344,4.7180890370452735,4.1632066517315,hawkish
625a5bf8a90491195f1eb4e0a14f7fcb1260759d,2022-08-27,speech,Monetary policy and the Great Volatility,Isabel Schnabel,,all_ECB_speeches.csv,"SPEECH Monetary policy and the Great Volatility Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming Jackson Hole, 27 August 2022 The Great Moderation was a period of prosperity and broad macroeconomic stability.[1] The volatility of both inflation and output declined, the length of economic expansions increased, and people in most economies experienced sustained improvements in their standards of living. There is broad agreement that better monetary policy was an important factor behind the Great Moderation.[2] As central banks took up the fight against spiralling inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, they brought down and stabilised inflation expectations at levels that provided a solid nominal anchor for firms and households. The subsequent advance of inflation targeting around the world is believed to be a prime reason why the global financial crisis of 2008 merely interrupted the Great Moderation.[3] Afterwards, macroeconomic volatility quickly dropped back to its previous low levels. Yet, monetary policy was not the only factor behind the Great Moderation. Good luck, in the sense of a smaller variance of the shocks hitting the global economy, is widely believed to have played an important role as well.[4] Compared with the 1970s, for example, real oil prices traded in a much narrower range from the second half of the 1980s until the mid-2000s. The question I would like to discuss this morning is whether the pandemic, and more recently Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, will herald a turning point for macroeconomic stability – that is, whether the Great Moderation will give way to a period of “Great Volatility” – or whether these shocks, albeit significant, will ultimately prove temporary, as was the case for the global financial crisis. My answer to this question is that of a “two-handed economist”. On the one hand, there is a tangible risk that the nature and persistence of the shocks hitting our economies will remain unfavourable over the coming years. On the other hand, the decisions that central banks are taking today to deal with high inflation can shape the future course of our economies in a way that mitigates and limits the ultimate impact of these shocks on prosperity and stability. A new era of volatility The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to an unprecedented increase in macroeconomic volatility. Output growth volatility in the euro area over the past two years was about five times as high as it was at the peak of the Great Recession in 2009.[5] Inflation volatility has surged beyond the levels seen during the 1970s. Once the exceptional effects of the pandemic and the war wash out from the data, output and inflation volatility are bound to decline. Yet, there are valid grounds to believe that policymakers will find themselves in a less favourable environment over the medium term – one in which shocks are potentially larger, more persistent and more frequent. Climate change is a major driver. The experience of recent years leaves no doubt that the incidence and severity of extreme and disruptive weather events are rising sharply, exposing the global economy to greater volatility in output and inflation.[6] This summer, the European Union – like many other parts of the world – is suffering from one of the most severe droughts on record, with nearly two-thirds of its territory in a state of alert or warning.[7] The pandemic and the war are likely to add to instability in the years to come. They challenge two of the fundamental stabilising forces that have contributed to the decline in volatility during the Great Moderation: globalisation and an elastic energy supply. Globalisation acted as a gigantic shock absorber. The breakup of the Soviet Union and global economic liberalisation from the 1980s onwards led to about half of today’s world population being integrated into the global economy. Labour supply became so abundant, and production capacity so large, that even periods of strong demand rarely succeeded in putting persistent upward pressure on prices and wages.[8] However, even before the pandemic, protectionism and nationalism were on the rise.[9] Tariff and non-tariff barriers were raised as the benefits of free trade were increasingly being called into question.[10] Today, the world economy is at risk of fracturing into competing security and trade blocs. The international network that connects our economies is fragile. We are witnessing new and alarming forms of protectionism. Consider health. Although vaccines have been rolled out in advanced economies for nearly two years now, a third of the world population is still unvaccinated. Unequal access to effective COVID-19 vaccines means that ending the pandemic remains elusive. Food protectionism, meanwhile, is causing misery and social unrest in parts of the world. The number of governments imposing export restrictions on food and fertilizers is close to that recorded during the 2008-2012 food crisis, exacerbating the repercussions of the war on food supply. Protectionism is going hand-in-hand with a fundamental reappraisal of global value chains. Many critical inputs to our modern societies, such as semiconductor chips, are produced in just a handful of countries. Europe’s energy crisis has exposed the deep fragilities of such an economic system. Efforts to enhance diversification will help secure strategic autonomy and make value chains more robust. But they also imply duplication and inefficiency. And if used as a form of protectionism, a greater reliance on domestic production may leave countries more – rather than less – vulnerable to shocks in the future.[11] The second stabilising force – an elastic energy supply – will also become less powerful in absorbing shocks in the years to come. Following the oil price shocks of the 1970s, the distribution of global oil supply changed drastically. OPEC’s global market share fell from 53% in 1973 to 28% in 1985 as Mexico, Norway and other countries started producing significant amounts of oil.[12] The “Shale Revolution” in the United States, which started at the turn of the century, changed the oil market once again. It is estimated to have resulted in a significant increase in the price elasticity of oil and gas supply.[13] As a result, just as globalisation led to excess supply in product and labour markets, limiting price and wage increases, the emergence of the United States as a large net exporter of energy buffered the impact of demand shocks on oil and gas prices over the past 15 years. The green transition and the war in Ukraine will lastingly make fossil energy scarcer and more expensive at a time when renewable energy carriers are not yet sufficiently scalable. Over the coming months, acute shortages, in particular in Europe, may require painful adjustments to production and consumption. The shift to greener technologies will reduce such pressures over the longer run, but it will also broaden the sources of energy shocks during the transition. Most green technologies require significant amounts of metals and minerals, such as copper, lithium and cobalt. As their supply is constrained in the short and medium term, and often concentrated in a small number of countries, action to quickly reduce our dependency on fossil energy will lead to firms and governments competing for scarce commodities, thereby pushing up prices.[14] Of course, such fundamental and disruptive changes to the structure of our economies also offer important opportunities. There is hope that the war in Ukraine unites those who embrace the values of liberty, territorial integrity and democracy. And the determined fight against climate change holds the potential for strong and sustainable growth. But even then, the challenges we are facing are likely to bring about larger, more frequent and more persistent shocks in the years ahead. The role of monetary policy The transition to the Great Volatility is not a pre-determined outcome, however. If the nature of the shocks changes – that is, if one of the factors that had contributed to the Great Moderation subsides – the other factor – better policies – becomes more important in ensuring macroeconomic stability. Fiscal policy will play an important role in enhancing the resilience of our economies. Governments need to adapt their policies to the risk of a protracted period of lower potential output growth. With debt-to-GDP ratios at or close to historical highs, spending should focus on protecting social cohesion and promoting productive and green investments that will help secure long-term prosperity and rebuild fiscal space needed to cushion future shocks. Monetary policy, in turn, needs to protect price stability. What this means in an environment of elevated volatility and structural change is, however, controversial. Because monetary policy operates with long lags, price stability is typically defined over the medium term, giving central banks some discretion over the extent and length of inflation overshoots that they are willing to tolerate over the short run. This discretion is particularly relevant in the case of supply-side shocks that tend to push prices and output in opposite directions. Stabilising inflation is then no longer equivalent to stabilising output – the divine coincidence of monetary policy disappears.[15] Such shocks therefore imply a trade-off for monetary policy, between inflation and output. The experience of the 1970s suggests that the extent of this trade-off is highly path dependent. A poorly chosen course of action can make attaining price stability significantly more costly in the future. This path dependency puts a heavy weight on the decisions that central banks are taking in response to the challenges we are facing today. For the first time in four decades, central banks need to prove how determined they are to protect price stability. The pandemic and the war are consistently suppressing the level of aggregate supply at a time of strong pent-up demand, leading to sharp price pressures across a large range of goods and services. There are two broad paths central banks can take to deal with current high inflation: one is a path of caution, in line with the view that monetary policy is the wrong medicine to deal with supply shocks.[16] The other path is one of determination. On this path, monetary policy responds more forcefully to the current bout of inflation, even at the risk of lower growth and higher unemployment. This is the “robust control” approach to monetary policy that minimises the risks of very bad economic outcomes in the future.[17] Three broad observations speak in favour of central banks choosing the latter path: the uncertainty about the persistence of inflation, the threats to central bank credibility and the potential costs of acting too late. Uncertainty about inflation persistence requires a forceful policy response The first observation relates to how central banks should act in the current environment of large uncertainty. William Brainard’s well-known attenuation principle suggests that central banks should tread carefully in the face of uncertainty about how their policies are transmitted to the broader economy.[18] There are at least two conceptual cases where the Brainard principle breaks down. One is the existence of the effective lower bound. The best way for central banks to avoid the perils of a liquidity trap is to ease policy swiftly when a disinflationary shock hits the economy in the vicinity of the lower bound.[19] This principle has become a cornerstone of the monetary policy strategies of many central banks, including the ECB. The second case is when there is uncertainty about the persistence of inflation. When the degree of inflation persistence is uncertain, optimal policy prescribes a forceful response to a deviation of inflation from the target to reduce the risks of inflation remaining high for too long. [20] In this case, it is largely irrelevant whether inflation is driven by supply or demand. If a central bank underestimates the persistence of inflation – as most of us have done over the past one-and-a-half years – and if it is slow to adapt its policies as a result, the costs may be substantial.[21] In the current environment, these risks remain significant. Unprecedented pipeline pressures, tight labour markets and the remaining restrictions on aggregate supply threaten to feed an inflationary process that is becoming harder to control the more hesitantly we act on it. About 20 years ago, here in Jackson Hole, Carl Walsh was clear about what this implies for the conduct of monetary policy: to reduce the risks of a Volcker-type policy shock, central banks should conduct policy assuming that inflation is persistent, as the costs of underestimating persistence are higher than those of overestimating it.[22] Such a policy naturally puts a stronger emphasis on incoming data. Two sets of indicators matter most for deciding on the policy adjustment required to restore price stability. One is actual inflation outcomes along the entire pricing chain. These play a more critical role than they would normally do, as they serve as an important reference point for policymakers to evaluate future pipeline pressures, the forces driving inflation persistence and risks of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. The other is data on the state of the economy to assess how fast supply and demand imbalances are correcting in response to both changes in interest rates and the repercussions of adverse supply-side shocks. At the same time, the nature of inflation uncertainty implies that forward guidance on the future path of short-term interest rates becomes less relevant, or that it even risks adding to volatility rather than reducing it. A key condition for the success of forward guidance in steering expectations over the past decade was a macroeconomic environment characterised by both historically low inflation volatility and the constraints of the effective lower bound. Forward guidance is less appropriate in conditions of high volatility. When shocks are large and frequent, central banks can give no reliable signal about the future path of short-term interest rates, other than the broad direction of travel consistent with a reaction function that is calibrated on the assumption of high inflation persistence. Risks of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations are rising The second observation tilting the trade-off facing monetary policy towards more forceful action relates to central banks’ credibility. Our currencies are stable because people trust that we will preserve their purchasing power. For politically independent central banks, establishing and maintaining that trust is an important policy objective in and of itself. Failing to honour this trust may carry large political costs.[23] History is full of examples of high and persistent inflation causing social unrest. Recent events around the world suggest that the current inflation shock is no exception. Sudden and large losses in purchasing power can test even stable democracies. Surveys suggest that the surge in inflation has started to lower trust in our institutions.[24] Young people, in particular, have no living memory of central banks fighting inflation. We are witnessing a steady and sustained rise in medium and long-term inflation expectations in parts of the population that risks increasing inflation persistence beyond the initial shock. In the euro area, consumers’ medium-term inflation expectations were firmly anchored at our 2% target throughout the pandemic. According to the most recent data, median expectations are close to 3%, while average expectations have increased from 3% a year ago to almost 5% today.[25] Average long-term inflation expectations of professional forecasters, too, have started to gradually move away from our 2% target. In July, they stood at 2.2%, a historical high. For both consumers and professional forecasters, we are also observing a marked increase in the right tail of the distribution – that is, the share of survey participants who expect inflation to stabilise at levels well above our 2% target.[26] Option prices in financial markets paint a similar picture.[27] In the 1970s, such shifts in the right tail of the distribution preceded shifts in the mean.[28] We broadly know why these shifts happen among consumers who are financially less literate. These consumers predominately form their expectations based on inflation experiences.[29] But for the euro area, the ECB’s consumer expectations survey shows that people who are financially more literate and who see themselves as playing a relevant role in actual price and wage-setting have recently revised their medium-term inflation expectations to a larger extent than other survey participants. This is a source of concern. Unlike for consumers who form their expectations based on their experience of inflation, the higher inflation expectations of financially literate people are unlikely to subside if and when inflation starts decelerating. This increases the probability of second-round effects. We cannot say for certain what is behind these upward revisions to inflation expectations. But two potential explanations come to mind. One is that higher medium-term inflation expectations may be the result of a perception that monetary policymakers have reacted too slowly to the current high inflation. A cardinal principle of optimal policy in a situation of above-target inflation is to raise nominal rates by more than the change in expected inflation – the Taylor principle. If real short-term interest rates fail to increase, monetary policy will be ineffective in dealing with high inflation. In the United States, a systematic failure to uphold the Taylor principle was one of the key factors contributing to the persistence of inflation in the 1970s.[30] The second explanation is that higher inflation expectations may reflect more fundamental concerns, possibly related to fiscal and financial dominance, or to the recent review of central banks’ monetary policy frameworks that focused more on the challenges of too-low inflation rather than too-high inflation.[31] All these factors may have created perceptions of a higher tolerance for inflation and a stronger desire to stabilise output. Determined action is needed to break these perceptions. If uncertainty about our reaction function is undermining trust in our commitment to securing price stability, a cautious approach to policymaking will no longer be the appropriate course of action. Instead, a politically independent central bank needs to put less weight on stabilising output than it would when inflation expectations are well anchored. Policymakers should also not pause at the first sign of a potential turn in inflationary pressures, such as an easing of supply chain disruptions. Rather, they need to signal their strong determination to bring inflation back to target quickly.[32] This is another key lesson of the 1970s. If the public expects central banks to lower their guard in the face of risks to economic growth – that is, if they abandon their fight against inflation prematurely – then we risk seeing a much sharper correction down the road if inflation becomes entrenched. Central banks are facing a higher sacrifice ratio The third, and closely related, observation that supports a more forceful policy response relates to the potential costs of acting too late – that is, when high inflation has become fundamentally entrenched in expectations, a situation that neither the United States nor the euro area are facing today. In the early 1980s, many central banks had to tolerate large and costly increases in unemployment to restore confidence in the nominal anchor. There are at least three reasons to believe that a similar endeavour could be even more costly today in terms of lost output and employment. One is that our economies have become less interest rate-sensitive over time, meaning that more withdrawal of monetary accommodation would be required for a given desired decline in inflation. The growing importance of intangible capital is partially responsible for this. In the United States, its share in total investment has tripled since 1980. And in the euro area, it has increased from about 12% in 1995 to 23% today. Research finds that intangible capital-intensive firms tend to be net savers because intangible capital is more difficult to mobilise as collateral for bank lending, making the cost of credit less important.[33] These effects are reinforced by the structural shift towards services, which tend to be, on average, less responsive to monetary policy than more capital-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.[34] The second reason why a de-anchoring of inflation expectations has become more costly relates to the slope of the Phillips curve. There is a wealth of studies that find that the Phillips curve has become flatter over the past few decades.[35] Before the pandemic, a flat Phillips curve meant that central banks could allow the economy to run hot before inflationary pressures would emerge. Today, a flat Phillips curve means that lowering inflation – once it has become entrenched – potentially requires a deep contraction. The third reason concerns the relevant measure of slack. Even if the true slope of the Phillips curve were to be steeper than is suggested by reduced-form estimates, the fact that it is often global rather than domestic slack that matters for price-setting reduces the sensitivity of the economy to interest rate changes on a much broader level.[36] The events of the past one-and-a-half years are testimony to the increased relevance of global economic conditions for inflation.[37] In other words, central banks are likely to face a higher sacrifice ratio compared with the 1980s, even if prices were to respond more strongly to changes in domestic economic conditions, as the globalisation of inflation makes it more difficult for central banks to control price pressures. Conclusion Let me conclude. High inflation has become the dominant concern of citizens in many countries. Both the likelihood and the cost of current high inflation becoming entrenched in expectations are uncomfortably high. In this environment, central banks need to act forcefully. They need to lean with determination against the risk of people starting to doubt the long-term stability of our fiat currencies. Regaining and preserving trust requires us to bring inflation back to target quickly. The longer inflation stays high, the greater the risk that the public will lose confidence in our determination and ability to preserve purchasing power. Trust in our institutions is even more important at a time of major and disruptive structural change that brings about larger, more persistent and more frequent shocks. A reliable nominal anchor eases the transition towards the new equilibrium, and improves the trade-off facing central banks in the future. All in all, therefore, an important lesson from the Great Moderation is that it is also up to central banks whether the challenges we are facing today will lead to the Great Volatility, or whether the pandemic and the war in Ukraine will ultimately be remembered as painful but temporary interruptions of the Great Moderation.

Medium-term inflation refers to inflation three years ahead. Systematic data on firms’ medium-term inflation expectations remain scarce. Recent analysis, however, suggests that firms may use price changes observed along the supply chain to form their expectations. See Albagli, E., Grigoli, F. and Luttini, E.

There is abundant empirical evidence suggesting that inflation expectations are adaptive, meaning that the current long period of very high energy and food prices will shape people’s beliefs about the future.

While headline inflation is likely to decline steeply this year, driven by falling energy prices and easing supply bottlenecks, underlying inflation dynamics remain strong. In such an environment, our ultimate goal is clear: we must – and we will – bring down inflation to our medium-term target in a timely manner. But to achieve this goal we need a robust strategy, which takes into account the high levels of uncertainty we are facing today. As John Maynard Keynes once observed, “it would be foolish, in forming our expectations, to attach great weight to matters which are very uncertain”. In current conditions, a robust strategy calls for a data-dependent approach to making policy and a clear reaction function so that the public understands the sources of information that will be important to us. To that end, our future policy path will be determined by three factors: our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. At the same time, I have made clear that there is no trade-off between price stability and financial stability. We have plenty of tools to provide liquidity support to the financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy. In my remarks today, I will discuss our policy path so far and what lies ahead. And I will explain the reaction function that will govern our future rate decisions. The path so far Last year, inflation in the euro area surged strongly, and spread deeply, because it was driven by two types of shocks which hit the economy at the same time. First, we underwent an unprecedented series of negative supply shocks caused by pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis. This significantly increased input costs for all sectors of the economy. Second, we faced a positive demand shock caused by the reopening of the economy after the pandemic. That favourable demand environment allowed firms to pass rising input costs through to prices much faster and more strongly than in the past.[1] Our policy stance was starting from highly accommodative levels, having been tailored to the very-low inflation environment of the past decade and the initial deflationary risks of the pandemic. So, we had to adjust, as quickly as possible, a stance that had become inadequate. This initially placed important emphasis on signalling, i.e. demonstrating, through actions and commitments, that monetary policy would cover the necessary ground decisively. That is why we put a great weight on the pace of our actions, hiking rates in large increments. And we also communicated a clear upward path for rates, so that the public could be confident that monetary policy was on an anti-inflationary path, and that rates would soon leave accommodative territory. In a sense, an emphasis on data dependence was less important because monetary policy had distance to cover across all scenarios. But as the inflation outlook evolved, it became clear that a pure normalisation of policy – which would imply achieving a broadly neutral stance – would not suffice in itself. The combination of shocks had two effects – on distance and persistence – which warranted further policy action. First, the shocks increased the distance of inflation from our target. Even though inflation has likely passed its peak, it is descending from very high levels, and it is projected to be too far above our target for too long. The longer inflation is too high, the greater the danger that it remains so. Second, the shocks also increased the risk that above-target inflation becomes more persistent. In particular, price pressures have broadened and deepened. Measures of underlying inflation tracked by the ECB currently range between 4% and 8%. In this setting, we needed to bring rates to sufficiently restrictive levels to dampen demand. And, in doing so, we could keep a firm grip on inflation expectations and ensure they remain anchored. That is a key reason why we committed to raise interest rates significantly and at a steady pace over recent meetings – and why we decided last week that a further 50 basis point hike was necessary. The policy path ahead Now a sizeable policy adjustment is already behind us: since July last year we have raised interest rates by 350 basis points. However, inflation is still high, and uncertainty around its path ahead has increased. This makes a robust strategy going forward essential. Such a strategy has three elements. First, with high uncertainty, it is even more important that the rate path is data-dependent. This means, ex ante, that we are neither committed to raise further nor are we finished with hiking rates. Indeed, as I explained last week, if the baseline scenario in our most recent projections is confirmed, we will still have ground to cover to make sure that inflation pressures are stamped out. Second, while the European banking sector is resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions, in view of recent financial market volatility, we are ready to act and provide liquidity support to the financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy. But it should be clear that there is no trade-off between price stability and financial stability. As we have proven many times, we are able to set the appropriate policy stance to control inflation and at the same time use other instruments to address risks to monetary policy transmission. We did this when we decided to use reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme more flexibly, and when we agreed on the transmission protection instrument. These programmes ensured that rate normalisation proceeded smoothly. The third element of a robust strategy is a clear reaction function. At our last meeting, we clarified our reaction function and the sources of information that will be important to us. The future calibration of the rate path will be determined by – and will require continuous monitoring of – three key inputs, and this is what I will explain now. The inflation outlook The first input is our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data. This will be informed primarily by our staff inflation projections. Monetary policy must be forward-looking, given the lags with which our policy works. And the staff inflation projections are the best mechanism for distilling incoming economic and financial data into a comprehensive picture of medium-term inflation dynamics. The future rate path will depend on whether we see inflation converging durably to our target in our forecasts, and the level of confidence we have in this convergence as captured by the balance of risks. Our latest forecasts see headline inflation at 2.1% in 2025 and core inflation at 2.2%, which is a downward revision compared with our last projection round in December. But the confidence band around these forecasts is now unusually wide. As the cut-off date for the projection round was in early March, the forecasts do not incorporate the effects of the recent financial market tensions. Those tensions have added new downside risks and have made the risk assessment blurrier. More generally, many of the assumptions in the projections, such as those on fiscal policies and energy and food prices, are volatile. This implies additional uncertainty around the baseline for both growth and inflation. Some of this uncertainty will recede as the fallout from recent events in financial markets becomes clearer. But faced with overlapping shocks and shifting geopolitics, the level of uncertainty will most likely remain high. To confirm the outlook in our projections over time, we therefore also need to look at additional indicators that can be observed in real time. Underlying inflation To that end, the second input we will be drawing on is the dynamics of underlying inflation. Underlying inflation is not a policy target, but measures of underlying inflation can serve as a complementary cross-check of our forecasting process. Underlying inflation is typically quite inertial and therefore gives us an indication about the persistence of inflation into the medium term. We will be looking to see a sustained downward turn in underlying inflation measures to be confident that the inflation path will converge to our target in the medium term. So far, we do not see clear evidence that underlying inflation is trending downwards. In fact, we see two forces pushing underlying inflation in different directions. To the one side, falling energy prices are weakening a key driver of underlying inflation pressures. Imported energy prices have played a central role in pushing up inflation for all economic sectors, given the huge energy shock we have faced. This is why measures of underlying inflation that capture the more persistent effects of energy costs are already showing a decline.[2] To the other side, increasing domestic price pressures could offset some of this disinflationary impulse. Measures of underlying inflation that capture items sensitive to the business cycle – such as Supercore[3] – or items with low import content are still strengthening. If this continues and aggregate demand picks up from its current compressed levels, we could see a handover from imported to domestic price pressures that keeps overall price pressures high. The key issue in determining which of these forces wins out will be developments in wages. The euro area has suffered a large terms-of-trade loss owing to rising energy prices, the cost of which must ultimately be shared between firms and workers. And it is important that there is fair burden sharing between them, with both accepting that they cannot fully recover the income that the euro area has paid to the rest of the world and the ensuing loss of output. So far, real wages have decreased substantially, while firms’ profit margins have expanded in many sectors. But the labour market is quite tight, labour shortages are increasing, and the terms-of-trade shock has largely reversed. This is leading workers to use their bargaining power to recoup lost income. For the seven countries covered by the ECB’s wage tracker,[4] collective bargaining during 2022 led to an aggregate wage rise of 4.7% for this year. This is already playing a stronger role in core inflation. While wage-sensitive items[5] contributed only around 0.5 percentage points to core inflation before the pandemic, that contribution has more than doubled in recent months. If both workers and firms accept fair burden sharing, and stronger wage growth represents merely a rebalancing between labour and capital, then both wage and price pressures should diminish as this process plays out. But if both parties attempt to unilaterally minimise their losses, we could see a feedback mechanism between higher profit margins, wages and prices. The risk of such a “tit-for-tat” dynamic is also heightened by the prospect that labour market tightness will linger. Unlike other jurisdictions, labour participation in the euro area has grown robustly since last year[6], helping to address part of the soaring labour demand driven by reopening. But the pandemic has also led to a sharp increase in public employment[7], reducing the pool of labour available to the private sector. And how much further labour supply can expand overall will depend, among other things, on complex policy questions such as countries’ attitudes to immigration and childcare. At the same time, the unemployment rate is at a historical low and, in some countries, it is so low that it will be increasingly difficult to recruit from the remaining pool of labour. All this means that we could see a more prolonged cost-push shock coming from wage growth. This is unlikely to prevent goods disinflation, since wages represent only around 20% of direct input costs for manufacturing firms. But wages make up around 40% of direct input costs for services providers, and services inflation accounts for almost two-thirds of core inflation. In parallel, firms’ profit margins continue to grow, in part because some are taking advantage of supply-demand imbalances to test consumer demand with large price increases – over and above their increase in costs. But in the absence of a persistent rise in market power[8], this can only continue insofar as demand remains resilient. Otherwise, firms will have to absorb cost increases in margins and price pressures will start to ease. This is where the third input comes in that we will use to assess the rate path, which is the strength of the transmission of our policy measures in restricting demand. Policy transmission We saw a large contraction in domestic demand at the end of last year and the latest data, such as retail sales, suggest that consumption has not yet rebounded. But this has not stopped cost increases from passing through. Short-term measures of momentum in core inflation – for instance the three-month on three-month rate – actually increased in February. There are two factors which could explain this apparent resilience. The first is the atypical buffers for consumption that households have available in the current environment. They are still benefiting from sizeable fiscal policy support to shield them from rising energy prices, amounting to around €250 billion in 2022 and 2023, and they still have around €900 billion in excess savings built up during the pandemic.[9] The second factor is the reduced sensitivity of the labour market to slowing growth, which is supporting labour income and households’ employment expectations. Faced with labour shortages, firms are responding to weaker demand first by hoarding labour – that is, by further reducing hours worked rather than by cutting jobs. And now, with energy prices falling and wages rising, household disposable incomes are set to increase. This was reflected – before the recent financial market tensions arose – in our projections for a stronger recovery this year. So, for inflationary pressures to ease, it is important that our monetary policy works robustly in the restrictive direction. And that process is only starting to take effect now. The first leg of the monetary transmission process – from policy measures to financing and monetary conditions – is already having a substantial impact. The cost of borrowing is increasing steeply, and loan dynamics look to be contracting faster than during previous hiking cycles. Credit growth to firms has dropped markedly since the third quarter of last year. We are also seeing a tightening of money, with annual M1 growth turning negative for the first time since the creation of the euro area − although this is also being driven by the shifting of funds from overnight to better-remunerated time deposits in the context of higher rates. For the second leg of the transmission process – from tighter financing and monetary conditions to demand – there is currently more uncertainty. We know that the full effect of monetary policy on demand will only reveal itself over time. But both the strength and speed of this process could have changed. Since the ECB last conducted a major hiking cycle, in the mid-2000s, the financial structure of the euro area has evolved. The share of variable-rate mortgages has fallen, slowing the transmission of interest rate increases into debt payments. Excess savings and the low pass-through to deposit rates might also weaken incentives for households to save more of their income in response to higher policy rates. These factors could mean a weaker pass-through to consumption. At the same time, we have seen a very sudden shift from low-for-long rates to considerably higher levels – and this is already having an impact on more interest-sensitive demand components like investment. Housing investment has been falling for the past three quarters and business investment also contracted at the end of last year. The greater role today played by sectors that rely on discounted future earnings, such as tech, could also make monetary transmission more powerful. What we will have to monitor carefully in the weeks and months to come is whether there is a further strengthening of this pass-through. If, for example, banks start to apply a larger “intermediation wedge” – meaning that at any level of the base rate they demand a higher compensation for the perceived risk they are taking on when lending – then pass-through will become stronger. So, we will be paying close attention to a range of indicators of credit availability and credit pricing, such as the monthly data on money and credit flows, our bank lending survey and our survey on access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises. While more restrictive credit conditions are part of the mechanism by which our tightening ultimately reins in excess price pressures and brings inflation back to target, we will make sure that the process will be orderly throughout. Conclusion Let me conclude. Voltaire said “Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.” Faced with new and overlapping shocks, we have no choice today but to deal with uncertainty. But the public can be certain about one thing: we will deliver price stability, and bringing inflation back to 2% over the medium term is non-negotiable. We will do so by following a robust strategy that is data-dependent and embeds a readiness to act, but that does not entertain trade-offs around our primary objective. Faced with a world that is changing faster than any of us could have imagined, we need to be both focused on our goal and robust in our strategy to achieve it. Lagarde, C.

This is visible, for example, if one compares the persistent and common component of inflation (PCCI) and the PCCI excluding energy. The former has been declining strongly since the summer of last year, whereas the PCCI excluding energy has only stabilised.

Frankfurt am Main, 12 March 2025 Paul Valéry wrote that “the trouble with our times is that the future is not what it used to be”. Our expectations have indeed been swept aside in the last few years, and in the last few weeks in particular. Established certainties about the international order have been upended. Some alliances have become strained while others have drawn closer. We have seen political decisions that would have been unthinkable only a few months ago. The level of uncertainty we are facing is exceptionally high. An index of trade policy uncertainty currently stands at close to 350, more than six times its average value since 2021.[1] And indicators of geopolitical risk stand at levels not seen since the Cold War, outside of wars and major terrorist attacks.[2] This new environment raises fundamental questions for monetary policy. How can we deliver price stability in a new geopolitical era? Our strategy assessment is ongoing, as you know, and I will naturally not cover every issue in my speech today. I will focus on the factors I consider to be particularly relevant in this new era. I will ask three questions: how is the environment in which we operate changing? What do these changes imply for our reaction function? And what do the changes imply for our policy communication? My main message is that in an environment of uncertainty, a strong commitment to maintaining price stability over the medium term is more important than ever. This commitment will require agility to respond to new shocks, albeit within a well-defined framework that limits short-sighted reactions and unbridled discretion. As a result, we will need to continue steering the public’s expectations. People will be looking to us – and other policymakers – to understand how we will navigate this more volatile era and help reduce, rather than amplify, uncertainty. So, agility needs to be combined with clarity. Even when we cannot provide certainty about the rate path, we can provide clarity about our reaction function. The environment When we last reviewed our strategy, the main challenge we faced was a prolonged environment of too-low inflation. Although the review provided lessons that are relevant under any circumstances, its main focus was on understanding the causes of too-low inflation and how to ensure that it did not become embedded. The environment we are facing now is a different one. Three key changes stand out. First, the direction of shocks is much harder to predict. In the decade before our last strategy review, we faced a range of structural and cyclical forces that were almost uniformly disinflationary. Now, we are seeing notable shifts in the drivers of inflation. We still face structural factors like ageing and digitalisation that will probably be disinflationary in the coming years.[3] But we are also now facing new, two-sided shocks – mainly linked to trade and defence, as well as climate change – which can amplify or counteract the existing forces. Trade fragmentation[4] and higher defence spending in a capacity-constrained sector could in principle push up inflation. Yet US tariffs could also lower demand for EU exports and redirect excess capacity from China into Europe, which could push inflation down. Second, the size of the shocks to inflation could potentially change. In the period from the great financial crisis to our last strategy review, we faced some very large negative shocks to growth. The effect of these shocks on inflation, however, took time to materialise. We saw a slow-moving downward drift in inflation that eventually seeped into inflation expectations. But looking ahead, shocks might feed into inflation more directly and increase volatility. And this risk may be particularly acute for the euro area, as we are highly exposed to some of the new types of shock. For example, the euro area is very open to trade and part of integrated supply chains. Hence, trade fragmentation is likely to lead to larger, more disruptive relative price changes.[5] In a similar vein, the euro area is highly dependent on energy imports.[6] Geopolitical risks are likely to drive greater volatility in exchange rates and energy and commodity prices, as we have seen in recent weeks. Third, if the shocks do become larger, the persistence of inflation could in some circumstances be greater. One feature of the recent inflation shock was an increase in the frequency of price changes.[7] This can lead to a steepening of the Phillips curve and, more generally, to a proportionally stronger impact of large shocks on inflation. A model developed at the ECB suggests that inflation behaves in a visibly non-linear way: it reacts disproportionately more strongly to large shocks, whereas small shocks trigger no significant reactions.[8] If such state-dependent pricing becomes standard when the economy is hit by large shocks, but the frequency of wage-setting remains below that of price adjustment, we could see inflation becoming more persistent.[9] Large shocks would lead to a faster pass-through to inflation, and then wages would have to catch up with prices in a staggered way. As an illustration, energy inflation peaked in October 2022, while services inflation only peaked in July 2023 and is still being pushed up by past shocks today, mainly through their delayed impact on wage adjustments. In this environment of more uncertain, larger and possibly more persistent shocks, the way we have formulated our inflation target matters – that is, we aim for 2% inflation, our target is symmetric and we work to achieve it over the medium term. This symmetric target has served us well during the recent inflation surge, helping to coordinate expectations and guide the inflation process back down towards 2%. But the formulation does not mean that headline inflation will always be at 2%, which is impossible in the kind of environment we are facing now. It means that, regardless of the shocks we face, we must set our policy appropriately so that inflation is always converging back towards 2% over the medium term. So, how can we do that? This brings me to the second area: the reaction function. The reaction function Our reaction function has always been state-dependent. In other words, policy should react differently depending on the context and the origin, size and persistence of shocks. Our medium-term orientation enables us to avoid reacting to small or passing shocks that will have faded by the time the effects of a policy change kick in. And it allows us to flexibly adjust the horizon within which we must return inflation to target. Classically, monetary policy reacts more forcefully to demand shocks where output and inflation move together, and “looks through” or reacts less to supply shocks that push output and inflation in opposite directions – if they are sufficiently small and transitory. Empirical evidence based on the last two decades finds that the ECB has largely followed this prescription. Generally, it has reacted more strongly to demand shocks than to supply shocks. But it has responded to supply shocks more forcefully when these shocks were persistent and inflation was high.[10] The new environment requires us to emphasise two factors. The first is the anchoring of inflation expectations. For the ECB, “looking through” has always been conditional on inflation expectations remaining well anchored. The recent inflation surge has confirmed just how critical maintaining a strong anchoring is to successfully navigate a more volatile world. Our analysis finds that, if inflation expectations had been as poorly anchored as they were in the 1970s, policy rates would have had to rise to 8% at the peak of the recent tightening cycle to tame inflation, with very high costs for the economy.[11] With well-anchored expectations, recent disinflation has instead been achieved at a relatively low cost compared with similar episodes in the past.[12] This experience can, in some ways, give us confidence for the challenges ahead: the relative stability of longer-term inflation expectations during a massive inflation surge suggests that our inflation target has a high degree of credibility, which was reinforced by the decisive actions we took to keep inflation expectations anchored.[13] At the same time, our starting point for the recent inflation episode was a decade of too-low inflation and correspondingly subdued inflation expectations. This meant the public were initially inattentive to inflation and took time to update their views. But there is some evidence that public awareness has been awakened by recent experience. Once consumers took notice of rising inflation, their inflation perceptions responded quickly but reduced more sluggishly when inflation started to fall. This sluggish response has contributed to the slow adjustment of consumer inflation expectations, especially one year ahead. We will only know through careful observation how long these memories will last, and consequently how sensitive inflation expectations will be to new shocks. But in all scenarios, close monitoring of inflation expectations – across markets, analysts, forecasters, households and firms – will be central to our policy reaction function. Once the anchoring of inflation expectations is assured, the second factor we need to assess is how the current environment affects the optimal policy reaction to different type of shocks. If the Phillips curve becomes steeper at higher levels of inflation, meaning inflation responds faster to changes in activity, then it should also be easier for monetary policy to bring inflation down without imposing heavy costs on the economy. This would weaken one of the main rationales for “looking through” large supply shocks.[14] At the same time, there may be risks in generalising from recent experience where disinflation was relatively painless. Alongside well-anchored inflation expectations, the relatively low “sacrifice ratio” during this disinflation episode may reflect a unique set of conditions that will not be applicable to future shocks. In particular, the fact that we faced a series of negative shocks to income reduced the extent to which demand needed to be dampened by monetary tightening.[15] Any future shocks we face – such as energy price shocks and supply chain disruptions or a large increase in spending on defence or infrastructure – will therefore have to be assessed through this framework. All told, simple policy prescriptions will not be appropriate in the environment we now face. Within a well-articulated strategy and an unwavering commitment to price stability, we will need to retain agility to respond to complex circumstances as they arise. This has implications for our policy communication, which brings me to the third area. Policy communication Maintaining agility affects how we can talk about the future. And this applies particularly to our ability to give detailed guidance on the future path of interest rates. Forward guidance about the rate path is particularly useful under two circumstances. First, when the economy is faced with one-sided, persistent shocks pushing it towards the effective lower bound. In this setting, it gives the public confidence that monetary policy will be sufficiently persistent to dislodge those shocks and deliver on its target, while also helping insulate monetary conditions from spillovers from abroad. These benefits were all visible in the euro area from 2013 onwards when we first introduced rate forward guidance. Second, forward guidance can be useful when shocks become two-sided following a long time at the lower bound. In this case, it can help to lay out the conditions for rate lift-off in a way that hedges against false positives and prevents a premature tightening, and thereby reduces uncertainty about the future path of rates. However, one of the lessons of the recent period is that such guidance can become less helpful when uncertainty about the nature of the shocks is rising. In particular, some of the lift-off criteria we applied to our 2021 rate forward guidance were tied to the baseline inflation projections, but the projections were slow in catching on to the reality of a much more persistent inflation shock. The combination of factors that created this shock – a worldwide pandemic producing bottlenecks in various sectors upon reopening and a major energy crisis – had not been seen since the end of the World War One. But with hindsight, it would have been beneficial in our forward guidance to explicitly account for the risks and uncertainty surrounding the baseline. A general conclusion emerges: when the size and distribution of shocks becomes highly uncertain, we cannot provide certainty by committing to a particular rate path. Otherwise, forward guidance may constrain policy agility in the face of abrupt changes to the inflation environment. But we can provide clarity about our reaction function. We can still help the public to understand how we will navigate the new environment. First, we can clarify how we are likely to be affected by different states of the world. Since the pandemic, the ECB has been making greater use of scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis precisely to make our policy more robust to changing circumstances. These exercises, together with our discussion of the balance of risks, are designed to ensure that policymaking can remain forward-looking and stay ahead of the shocks to come. At present, we are considering various scenarios related to tariffs and fiscal policy changes, and what they will imply for growth and inflation.[16] Second, we can clarify what kind of data we will look at to make our decisions, which helps the public to distinguish signals from noise. This is why in March 2023 we set out three key inputs for policy decisions: the inflation outlook – comprising both the baseline and risks around it – the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. In the early phase of our rate tightening, before these criteria were introduced, we saw large monetary policy shocks – linked both to rate decisions and indications on future rates – as markets were looking for orientation. But after March 2023, market moves were less pronounced despite similar levels of interest rate uncertainty, which suggests that the markets better understood our reaction function. We also saw increased sensitivity to new data releases in the early tightening phase. But this diminished as markets understood which data we were focusing on and, especially, that data dependence should not be confused with “data-point dependence”.[17] The lesson I draw is that laying out a clear reaction function is critical to tempering volatility in a world of exceptional uncertainty. The public must understand the distribution of possible outcomes ahead and how the central bank will react once it is sufficiently confident about which scenario it is facing. In this way, clarity on the reaction function can be seen as providing framework guidance – i.e. a type of guidance that comes from the discipline implicit in a monetary policy framework – without pre-committing to any particular rate path, as the latter would excessively constrain agility. The three inputs we are currently using are designed to deliver robust policy in the face of the particular constellation of shocks that have hit the euro in recent years, especially the staggered pass-through of a large inflation surge to wages. Whether we continue to use those same inputs in future will depend on the nature of the shocks that confront us. Our strategy assessment should nonetheless commit to integrating risk and uncertainty about key factors into our reaction function. The data we draw on should capture not only our central projection for the economy, but also the uncertainty surrounding that projection and a rich, diverse set of risks. Conclusion Let me conclude. Thomas Jefferson said that “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty”. The same can be said of stability. Maintaining stability in a new era will be a formidable task. It will require an absolute commitment to our inflation target, the ability to parse which types of shocks will require a monetary reaction and the agility to react appropriately. Our response to the recent inflation episode should give the public confidence that we will always do whatever is necessary to deliver price stability – and that our policy frameworks can adapt to new circumstances. Central bankers will need to show agility to adjust their stance and their tools to changing circumstances, and they will need intellectual curiosity to challenge established principles and conventional wisdom.

Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB at the Barclays Capital Annual ConferenceLondon, 24 May 2007 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, It is an honour and a great pleasure for me to address you this evening. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss one of the issues that has puzzled me and, at times, concerned me the most during my two years on the ECB’s Executive Board. It is the issue of the so-called “secondary objective” of monetary policy. As you well know, the Treaty establishing the European Community states that, “ without prejudice” to the overriding objective of price stability, the ECB shall support the general objectives of the Community. These objectives are spelled out in Article 2 of the Treaty, namely: “… a harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of economic activities, a high level of employment and of social protection, … sustainable and non-inflationary growth, … and economic and social cohesion …”. And these objectives are all put at the same level, i.e. there is no specific hierarchy. However, when it comes to the part concerning monetary policy and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks, the Treaty clearly states that the primary objective of monetary policy is price stability, and that the other objectives, such as sustainable growth and employment, should only be supported “without prejudice” to price stability. This wording used in the Treaty seems to imply that there are two different ways through which monetary policy can support sustainable growth and employment: one that is without prejudice to price stability and the other that, instead, may constitute a prejudice to the primary objective. This therefore raises the question: what contribution can monetary policy make to the harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of economic activities that does not prejudice price stability? This is not a new question. Even before I came to the ECB, at my hearing before the European Parliament, I was asked: “ Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, how in your view should the ECB fulfil its secondary obligation under the Treaty (to contribute to economic growth and full employment) and what instruments could the ECB use to do so?”. Interestingly the same question has been put to all past and subsequent candidates. Perhaps one day somebody will finally give the “right” answer! But, joking aside, why is this issue so puzzling? Well, maybe it is because the answers provided by central bankers and most academics expert in monetary and financial economics are quite different from those of commentators and politicians. Bankers and economists, for example, would say that the best contribution that monetary policy can make to sustainable growth is to promote price stability; whereas certain politicians and commentators argue at times that central banks, including the ECB tend to focus too heavily on inflation, to the neglect of growth and employment. How can we rationalise and explain the reasons for such different views? How can we hope to lay the ground for a common understanding? Personally I am tempted to adopt a quite provocative line of reasoning and ask: well, what would happen if we set, as the primary objective of monetary policy, the achievement of “harmonious, balanced and sustainable growth” rather than price stability? Would monetary policy be substantially different from the one of a central bank pursuing price stability as its primary objective, as is the case of the ECB? Would it all make a difference? The answer depends on the underlying model of the economy that one has in mind. I will contend that those who think that monetary policy has a choice between output stability and price stability base their view on a very specific assumption about the way the economy functions, and in particular about how agents form their expectations. Once these assumptions are relaxed, and a more realistic view of the world is adopted, it can be demonstrated that monetary policy has no choice, if it wants to support growth, but to consistently promote price stability over the medium term in a credible fashion. I would like to structure my remarks as follows. I will start from a simple mainstream New Keynesian model of the economy, and then consider more complicated, but more realistic, models. Based on this analysis, I will then explain what the general consensus is among central bankers virtually worldwide, independently of what their central bank statutes formally state, and provide some relevant empirical evidence on the issue. Finally, I would like to discuss briefly some of the risks involved in an environment of price stability, mainly in terms of the complacency of both policy-makers and market participants. And then I will conclude. The simple theoretical model Let me start from a simple theoretical model. In the standard New Keynesian framework, with rational expectations and full information by the central bank, the existence of a trade-off between output stability and price stability depends on the nature of the shocks hitting the economy. Demand shocks do not pose any dilemma for monetary policy, since the interest rate reaction aimed at stabilising inflation is consistent with that aimed at stabilising output. By contrast, cost push shocks (i.e. shocks driving up inflation, independently of demand conditions) are a dilemma for monetary policy, since the interest rate reaction to stabilise inflation is of an opposite direction to that required to stabilise output. For these shocks, the central bank must make a choice between stabilising inflation or output, or a combination of both. [1] In this analytical framework, the way in which the central bank reacts to a cost push shock entails a choice between two competing objectives: the stabilisation of inflation variability or the stabilisation of output variability. Indeed, a central bank aiming primarily at stabilising output would have to compromise on inflation stability and vice versa. It would thus make a difference, in terms of price stability or output stability, whether the central bank had as its primary objective the former or the latter. This explains the interest of observers, market participants and politicians in trying to understand and, in some cases, also to influence, central bank preferences. The key assumptions of this model is that the central bank has full knowledge of the structure of the economy and of the shocks affecting it and that agents are fully rational and know perfectly the objectives and preferences of the central bank. In this full-information and fully-rational context, there is a well-defined and stable trade-off between output and inflation variability (known as the Phillips curve). The central bank has to choose a point along an efficiency frontier and ensure that its behaviour is consistent with, and therefore validates agents’ expectations in a repeated game context. Based on this analytical framework, the literature has developed normative prescriptions on the optimal behaviour of the central bank, which can be described according to an optimal policy rule, conditional on the structure of the economy and the shocks hitting it. This type of model is certainly useful, largely because of its simplicity and thus its ability to derive simple policy rules for the central bank. However, the gap between model and reality may be a bit too wide. Let me emphasise one key assumption that underpins the model, which might be (a bit) unrealistic: in these models, central banks are considered as some sort of gods, in which all economic agents fully believe, just like religious fanatics. In such a world, the issue of central bank credibility does not arise, by definition, because the central bank has full knowledge of the economy and always behaves optimally, hitting whatever target it is given. There is only one Phillips curve, along which different equilibria are determined. The central bank has just to decide the point along the curve that it decides to target and then achieve it. However, although being likened to gods may be flattering for central banks, it is unfortunately somewhat exaggerated and removed from reality. Economic agents, especially market participants, certainly do not believe unconditionally in central banks and tend to behave rather like St Thomas: see first, then believe. Thus, central bank credibility cannot be taken for granted: it is continuously tested, and rightly so, by the markets. This suggests that some of the assumptions underlying the theoretical models used to analyse monetary policy might be too simplistic. More realistic models Substantial research has been carried out in recent years to model inflation expectations in a more realistic way. Models of learning, imperfect knowledge and bounded rationality are becoming increasingly widespread in monetary economics. [2] In short, these models are based on a “signal extraction” problem, whereby economic agents learn, albeit slowly and in an imperfect manner, the underlying (and possibly time-varying) central bank preferences, including the inflation target. They do this by observing the behaviour of the target over time, when there is one, and by looking at the resulting inflation performance. And inflation expectations tend to be particularly sensitive to sustained deviations between observed inflation and its (announced or perceived) target. In such models, when the economy is hit by a shock that temporarily increases inflation, agents consider that the objective of the central bank might have changed, and possibly increased above previous expectations. Divergences between inflation expectations and the inflation target affect the persistency of inflationary pressures following an exogenous shock, thereby making it more costly (in terms of lost output) for the central bank to bring inflation back to the target. [3] In these models, there is no single trade-off between output and inflation variability, but a multiplicity of trade-offs, depending on the way inflation expectations are formed. If inflation expectations rise, for whatever reason, the efficiency frontier between output and inflation stabilisation is shifted outwards, raising both output and inflation variability. The higher the level of inflation expectations is, the higher the level of output variability is for any given level of inflation, and vice versa. That is why it is so important for inflation expectations to remain as close as possible to the target, especially after an exogenous shock. It is a way to keep the inflation-output trade-off as favourable as possible and thus minimise both output and inflation variability. In more sophisticated models, the anchoring of inflationary expectations to their target is essential, not only in the face of cost push shocks, as previously examined, but also in the face of demand shocks. Given that there are lags between the impact of demand shocks on output and the impact on prices – the former generally being quicker than the latter – the dynamics of inflation might differ substantially from those of output growth, especially at turning points in the cycle. This poses a challenge to monetary policy in the presence of less-than-perfect foresight/rational expectations. For instance, as the economy reaches a cyclical peak, the slowdown in economic activity would normally tend to precede the adjustment in price dynamics, as inflationary pressures might continue for some time, especially in the presence of labour and product market rigidities. In the ideal world of perfect anchoring of inflation expectations and full central bank credibility that I considered initially, there would be no problem for monetary policy: inflation expectations are always aligned to the target, and observed inflation adjusts rapidly to the cyclical conditions. Under such circumstances, monetary policy can follow quite closely the cyclical pattern in output and easing takes place as soon as the economy slows down, thus supporting economic activity. There is no contradiction between the two objectives. If, instead, inflationary expectations are not fully aligned with the target, the central bank may well face a dilemma. As the economy slows down, the central bank might decide to reduce interest rates, ignoring inflationary pressures and expectations. However, this might create the suspicion by economic agents that the central bank has changed its inflation target. The divergence between inflation expectations and the target might further increase, adding to inflation persistence and volatility. To bring inflation down, the central bank will ultimately have to maintain a tight stance for a longer period of time, despite the economic slowdown, and this will add to output volatility. If inflation expectations are allowed to be disanchored, monetary policy will turn out to be much more restrictive than would be the case with anchored expectations; inflation volatility will come at the price of greater output volatility. The more inflation expectations are aligned with the target, the quicker monetary policy can be adjusted to the underlying economic conditions. This is why central banks communicate publicly that their primary focus is price stability, even as the economy slows down, so that they can anchor expectations and therefore align as quickly as possible their interest rate policy with the underlying macroeconomic conditions. To sum up, in a world in which credibility is not taken for granted, i.e. central banks are not infallible, the trade-off between price stability and output stability is greatly diminished, both under cost and demand shocks. For monetary policy to support growth, it has to ensure price stability in a credible way. Central banks’ views Central banks in the industrial world follow an approach that derives from the more realistic models I have just described. They do not consider themselves to be infallible, but rather see their ability to anchor expectations as a key asset; one that takes a long time to build up, but also one that can be lost very quickly. Under such conditions, maintaining price stability is necessary to foster sustainable development. Let me give you three recent quotes by three different Central Banks. I leave it up to you to guess where they come from (but they are not from the ECB!): “By keeping inflation on track to meet the 2% target in the medium term, thus ensuring price stability, the Bank is providing a platform of macroeconomic stability which is the best contribution monetary policy can make to the objectives of high and stable levels of economic growth and employment.” [4] “Experience shows that low and stable inflation and inflation expectations are also associated with greater short-term stability in output and employment, perhaps in part because they give the central bank greater latitude to counter transitory disturbances to the economy. […] In sum, achieving price stability is not only important in itself; it is also central to attaining the other mandated objectives of maximum sustainable employment and moderate long-term interest rates.” [5] “Price stability is an indispensable prerequisite for realizing sustainable growth, and the Bank is responsible for realizing price stability through an appropriate conduct of monetary policy.” [6] What is interesting about these three quotes is that they reflect a common view, independently of the institutional framework in which the three Central Banks operate and also of the underlying stage of the cycle in the various countries. This was also reflected in the most recent G7 communiqué of 13 April 2007, which stated that: “ We [the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7] continue to be committed to maintaining price stability as the best contribution that monetary policy can make to sustained global growth”. So there is a striking degree of consensus in policy-making circles that price stability and output stability are two sides of the same coin, and that there is no exploitable trade-off between these two objectives, at least not over the medium term. The evidence There is a substantial amount of evidence confirming the result derived from the more realistic models, which indicates that the more inflation expectations are anchored, the more monetary policy can be supportive of economic activity. Economic history has shown that inflation was more persistent during the period of Great Inflation in the 1970s and much less persistent during the period of stable prices. According to some studies, inflation appears to have been less persistent in Germany (a country where the Great Inflation was much less severe) than in other industrial countries, although there is some debate surrounding this. [7] Moreover, although there are many explanations of the Great Moderation, i.e. the radical reduction in output growth volatility experienced in the last two decades, [8] it is generally accepted that the Great Disinflation was accompanied by a marked decline of output volatility, not only in the United States, but also on a global scale (Japan being an exception). There is, on the other hand, no evidence that lower real GDP growth volatility has been obtained at the expense of somewhat higher inflation volatility; in fact, if anything, the opposite seems to be true, also if we look across countries. [9] In addition, there is significant empirical support for the proposition that inflation negatively affects long-term growth, even at relatively low levels of inflation. [10] Finally, there is also some evidence that banking crises are more frequent in countries with high and variable inflation. [11] Furthermore, we might have to reconsider the view that the high macroeconomic stability in the United States in the period following the mid-1980s might be attributed to increased monetary policy activism, known as “the resurrection of fine-tuning” [12]. There is recent evidence that the so-called period of Great Moderation is a global phenomenon which occurred at the same time as the Great Disinflation and the beginning of the period of stable prices, although there is not necessarily a direct causal link between the two. The reduction in output growth volatility after the mid-eighties (the end of the Great Inflation) was, in fact, not limited to the United States. Moreover, the evidence that output growth volatility actually picked up at the onset of the Great Inflation reinforces this point. [13] Long and short-term interest rates the world over have also become significantly less variable and lower in real terms. [14] The evidence would seem to confirm that it is the focus on price stability and the anchoring of inflation expectations which have contributed to reducing output volatility, rather than increased activism on the part of the Federal Reserve. In any case, recent research shows that differences in the institutional structure, the mandate or even the environment do not lead central banks to behave differently in their attempts to combat inflation. [15] A recent study, for instance, compared the behaviour of the ECB and the Federal Reserve against the background of a similar structural model, estimated respectively on euro area and US data. The results show that, had the ECB followed the same estimated monetary policy rule as the Fed and applied it to the euro area economy, its contribution to economic growth in the period 2001-06 would not have been greater; actually the opposite holds true. [16] Another paper, using a different estimated model for the euro area and the United States, found that differences in the type, size and persistence of shocks explain the different interest rates between the two areas, rather than differences in the monetary policy reaction function. [17] This would suggest that comparisons between different interest rate levels at different times in different countries do not necessarily lead to concluding that a central bank assigns a greater weight to supporting economic activity than another. Looking at the most recent period, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that short-term interest rates in the euro area are currently significantly lower than in the United States, by over 100 basis points, despite GDP growth being stronger on this side of the Atlantic, for over a year now. This might be partly linked to the fact that inflation expectations have been systematically lower and more stable in the euro area. The same holds true in a comparison with the United Kingdom. We need to understand why inflation expectations have remained relatively low and stable in the euro area, and market participants are among the best placed to answer this question. I would contend that the reason is that the ECB has acquired over the years substantial credibility as an inflation fighter. This is the main reason why interest rates are relatively low in the euro area. This confirms that promoting price stability is fully consistent with, and actually the best way to promote, sustainable growth. To sum up, evidence suggests that central banks aim to stabilise output growth primarily by stabilising prices and anchoring inflation expectations. This is consistent with the models examined previously, which show that achieving price stability is instrumental in sustaining economic growth. Anchoring inflation expectations In the introduction I provocatively asked the question of whether monetary policy would differ if growth, rather than price stability, were the primary objective of a central bank. The arguments presented so far would suggest a negative answer. Since price stability is a way to achieve the ultimate objective of stable and sustainable growth, why do central bank statutes mention price stability as their main goal, rather than growth? Well, there are several reasons – one is accountability: growth depends on many things, price stability being one of them, and monetary policy should be held accountable only for what it can deliver over a certain period of time. Consider the following: the ultimate objective of a good diet is to be healthier and to live longer. However, any diet sets clear and unambiguous goals, in terms of a number of kilos or pounds that can be easily monitored. Another reason is very much linked to the features of the economic model previously described, and the importance of anchoring agents’ expectations. We know very little about how inflation expectations are formed. [18] Expectation phenomena are likely to be abrupt and non-linear, as studied for example in the finance literature. [19] They may be triggered by apparently irrelevant events. [20] Moreover, once expectations go off mark, it may be hard to bring them back under control. Nor can we assume that inflation expectations of households and firms are the same as those of financial market participants, which sometimes receive more attention. It has been shown in the literature that, in the presence of learning and bounded rationality, the optimal weight of inflation in the reaction function of the central bank must be higher. [21] This is one of the reasons why it is important to have a clear quantitative definition of price stability. [22] In this context, an institutional framework safeguarding central bank independence and a clear indication of a quantitative definition of price stability, to which the monetary authority may be held accountable, are very helpful. Ultimately, however, there is no substitute for a track record of being able and determined to maintain price stability; in fact, there is evidence that long-term inflation expectations have traditionally been lagging, rather than leading, indicators of actual inflation. [23] All in all, if fostering sustainable growth is what matters, it pays off for society as a whole to have central bankers who are a bit obsessed about inflation! The risks I am nearing the end of my address, but I would just like to mention very briefly one risk that may arise in an environment of apparently solidly entrenched price stability, which is what we currently witness in most industrial and also developing countries. The risk I am referring to is complacency: complacency by both the central banks and the private sector, primarily market participants. For monetary authorities the risk is to forget that keeping well-anchored inflation expectations and low inflation persistence requires, above all, a forward-looking and decisive reaction to inflationary pressures. [24] The central bank may occasionally have a hard time in convincing market participants and public opinion that monetary policy action is required, at times, to keep inflationary pressure under control. For market participants, the risk is that inflation expectations, for example those embedded in bond yields, progressively lose information and are not adequate to price, and protect against, possible risks. The absence of an adequate assessment of, and possibly insurance against, sudden shifts in inflation expectations could in turn aggravate the actual turmoil created by these phenomena, which are notoriously unpredictable. Thus, central banks have to move along a fine line between being credible and avoiding instilling too much complacency in market participants. From a longer-term perspective, we should not forget that the remarkable macroeconomic stability that we have witnessed in the past two decades has been rather exceptional. History is replete with periods of apparently unshakeable stability and prosperity being suddenly broken by instability and depression. For example, and with due regard to the different proportions, the instability following the First World War was preceded by a period of stability and progress during the belle époque which at the time seemed almost “natural” and ever lasting. The same can be said for the two decades after the Second World War, which were followed by 15 years of economic and financial instability. We have learnt from these episodes to develop institutions, most notably independent central banks, with the task of safeguarding price stability. These institutions can, however, adequately perform their functions in the long run if they have the continuous support and attention by market participants and the public at large. We also know that circumstances can become more adverse than they have been over the recent past. To sum up, the risk is that we all forget that inflation, even when dormant, is itself always a risk. Even at the cost of sounding boring – and this is ultimately our goal - it is the task of central banks to remind society of this risk, and to act to counteract such a risk. This creates a catch 22. Central banks must mention and explain the inflationary risks underlying the economy that might justify their policy actions, but they must also reassure markets and agents that their actions will counteract such risks so that, ultimately, price stability is ensured. The two messages are not necessarily easy to get through. A typical example of this difficulty is the question that is often put to central banks: why are you talking about inflation risks if inflation is low? Why are you raising rates, if there is price stability? The answer, which is not always fully understood, is that inflation is low because central banks act to ensure price stability, and they act based on their projection of underlying inflationary pressures. As history and analysis have shown, preventing central banks from playing such a role, of warning and acting to prevent inflation, does not produce more growth. The main risk of central banks is to become themselves victim of the so-called Goodhart law, which says that if you target successfully a variable with a given instrument, the observed statistical correlation between that instrument and the targeted variable tends to vanish. If the central bank’s interest rate policy is successful in ensuring price stability, there will be over time little or no observable correlation between interest rates and inflation. This certainly makes central banks' task of explaining their policy a bit challenging, and certainly not boring! Conclusions To conclude, let me just reiterate what I would call a “central bank consensus”. A strong focus on price stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make towards sustainable growth. Being focused on inflation over the medium term, rather than on a combination of inflation and output stability, helps to anchor inflation expectations and keep inflation persistence low and thus to foster output growth. Therefore, a central bank focused on price stability does exactly what a central bank aimed at promoting sustainable growth would do. I know that this consensus is widely shared by a large part of the academic world and certainly by financial market participants, who are those that ultimately assess the credibility of central banks. However, we have to recognise that this consensus is not yet fully shared by all, and still questioned in particular by some observers, commentators, politicians, sometimes social partners. Why is it the case? The answer that I tried to give is that many of these outside observers are influenced by economic models that are based on very restrictive assumptions, which might not be entirely realistic, especially concerning the way in which interest rates are determined in financial markets. One of these assumptions is that central banks have full knowledge of the economy and are not only infallible but also believed by market participants to be infallible. This raises a series of paradoxes. The first is that these models, and their underlying hypothesis of infallible central banks, are often used in the intention to put into doubt central banks infallibility and to criticize them for being stubborn inflation fighters, instead of growth promoters. A second paradox is that if central banks followed what these critics suggest, and aimed at the wrong target, for sure market participants will start doubting their infallibility. If this happens, the central bank would be incapable of exploiting any trade-off and would end with higher inflation and higher output variability. The third paradox is that when central banks’ credibility is put into question, maybe because of the criticisms of those that would want a more expansionary policy, the only way for central banks to regain credibility, in order to support growth, is to focus even more on fighting inflation. That is why central banks’ statutes mention price stability above all other objectives. And that is why central bankers are paid not only to worry about inflation risks, but also to make sure that these risks do not materialise, in particular by acting in a “firm and timely” fashion.

Knowledge about the pattern, nature and determinants of inflation persistence is crucial for the conduct of monetary policy. In fact, it was the Governing Council of the ECB that commissioned a comprehensive study of inflation persistence in the euro area following evidence that prices in the euro area respond only slowly to monetary policy shocks, and apparently more sluggishly than those in the United States. We are now more than halfway through the Inflation Persistence Network (IPN) project, which has already been an extensive research exercise, involving substantial resources and quite a number of Eurosystem staff, many of whom are here tonight. The work undertaken in the context of the IPN has been outstanding in that it has been extremely collaborative. The research areas of the ECB and all 12 national central banks of the Eurosystem have worked and will continue to work together on a joint project. This research design is innovative and highly productive, as shown by the two Eurosystem networks that have been active so far, namely the IPN and its predecessor, the Monetary Transmission Network. The aim of this conference is to take stock of the work of the IPN over the past two years. IPN researchers have studied the price-setting behaviour at the micro-level on the basis of individual goods prices and surveys. They have also analysed inflation persistence at the euro area, country and sectoral levels. Today, the results of their research have been discussed at length. Tomorrow, inflation persistence will be discussed in the context of structural models, and some initial conclusions will be drawn on what we have learnt. In my remarks, I will focus on the question as to what inflation persistence may imply for monetary policy. This is some heavy food for a dinner speech – food for thought -, so I will try to be as brief as possible. While I do not wish to pre-empt the discussion to be held in the context of the IPN in the course of next year, I will nevertheless give some first views, as this is a question of extreme importance and, in essence, the reason why the IPN was set up. More precisely, I will first address the choice of the optimal rate of inflation in an environment of price and wage stickiness. I will then discuss the controllability of inflation when it is subject to persistence and how this relates to the credibility of a central bank and, finally, I will touch upon the issue of inflation persistence in a heterogeneous currency area. The optimal rate of inflation Let me start with some thoughts on the optimal rate of inflation. When choosing a quantitative specification for the objective of price stability to be pursued by the central bank, a balance must be struck between the costs of inflation and the arguments for tolerating a small positive rate of inflation. The latter depends, among other factors, on the nature of the rigidities present in the economy. Economists have long argued that the interaction of nominal rigidities in prices and/or wages with inflation (but also with deflation) entails considerable welfare costs. Inflation blurs the signalling role of relative prices, thus reducing the efficiency of market allocations. This is particularly the case in the presence of symmetric nominal rigidities, which could hinder the adjustment of prices in both directions, upward and downward. Such symmetric rigidities could exist in the form of menu costs and “nominal lock-in”, by which I mean the inability of sellers to change or re-optimise their prices within a certain period. The findings of the IPN have confirmed the existence of price stickiness in the euro area, which is apparently somewhat greater than in the United States. The IPN suggests, for example, that retail prices change, on average, only once every year in the euro area, compared to a price change occurring on average every second quarter in the United States. It is important to note that when price changes occur in the euro area, they tend to be rather large (in the range of 8% to 10% at the retail level). The survey evidence on the pricing behaviour of firms also highlights the existence of frictions, stemming from contracts and coordination failures, for example, which prevent nominal prices from being adjusted even though a change would be warranted. The existence of rigidities has direct implications for aggregate welfare and the optimal rate of inflation: nominal rigidities hinder the adjustment of relative prices, thereby reducing economic efficiency. Importantly, any deviation from price stability would aggravate the loss in efficiency caused by nominal rigidities. The implications for monetary policy of this seem to be quite clear. Monetary policy should aim literally at price stability (i.e. zero inflation) to minimise the distortions to relative prices. Nevertheless, there may be arguments for tolerating small positive inflation rates. One argument is the existence of nominal asymmetric rigidities or, more specifically, nominal downward rigidities in prices (and wages). The economic adjustment of relative prices to shocks, and therefore resource allocation, could become slow and inefficient in the presence of downward nominal rigidities in wages and prices. In this respect, it has been argued that small amounts of inflation may actually “grease” the adjustment of relative prices, and – in turn – the real adjustment of the economy, to various shocks. I do not wish to enter here into a discussion on the conceptual foundations of downward nominal rigidities, which are rather contradictory and ambiguous. The empirical evidence of the importance of nominal downward rigidities, especially for the euro area, is also not conclusive. The IPN results do not suggest that downward rigidities in prices in the euro area are so pervasive. In actual fact, in all the countries analysed, price decreases seem to be almost as frequent and sizeable as price increases. The wage-setting side has not been studied within the IPN, but the International Wage Flexibility Project has provided some evidence in this regard. It suggests the existence of nominal downward stickiness in wages, although large nominal wage cuts can also be observed. It is worth mentioning here that, even if nominal downward rigidities are present, they should not necessarily be taken as given and that their reduction (and ultimately their removal) could be seen as one objective for structural economic policies. Overall, these considerations suggest that, regarding their impact on the safety margin for tolerable rates of inflation, nominal downward rigidities in the euro area seem to be only a secondary factor relative to other major factors, such as the presence of a zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. At the same time, the presence of high inflation persistence can exacerbate the problem of the zero lower bound given that once inflation is negative it is likely to stay there for some time. This would complicate the conduct of monetary policy in such circumstances. Controllability of inflation and the role of monetary policy This leads me to a further important issue in the context of inflation persistence and monetary policy: namely the controllability of inflation. Inflation developments in the euro area have displayed quite some stickiness over recent years. Despite the recent economic slowdown and generally weak economic growth over the past three to four years, inflation as measured by the HICP has remained above 2%, the upper bound of the ECB’s definition of price stability, for most of the time since mid-2000. This would generally suggest that inflation might be rather persistent in the euro area. However, one should not ignore the fact that a number of very specific shocks have impacted on inflation over recent years. To name just a few, there have been hikes in oil prices, stronger than normal increases in administered prices and indirect taxation and a number of food price-related shocks. Nevertheless, inflation persistence as such could have magnified the impact and duration of these shocks on inflation. From a theoretical point of view, the more flexible the economy the less persistent are usually the effects of shocks on output and inflation, as all relative prices adjust smoothly and quickly. Under such circumstances, the impact of shocks on the economy is easier to assess and monetary policy is more efficient. Flexibility at the micro-level therefore facilitates the conduct of monetary policy at the macro-level, as maintaining price stability becomes a somewhat easier task. However, the presence of inflation persistence renders monetary policy less efficient as it makes price and wage adjustment dependent on the sequence of shocks hitting the economy. In the first instance, higher inflation persistence increases inflation and delays the response of inflation to various shocks, to which monetary policy usually aims to react. It also prolongs the inflation (and output) effects of monetary policy actions. Moreover, inflation persistence may complicate the estimation of the impact of monetary policy moves on inflation as they can generate non-linear responses to shocks by making the transmission mechanism dependent on history. This is not easy to capture by models, and it heightens uncertainty. Last but not least and for the same reasons, the long horizon over which inflation responds to shocks (that are not observable in real time with certainty) could make it more difficult to forecast inflation developments, which is one, but an important, ingredient for the assessment of the outlook for medium-term price stability. These effects are particularly important when there is uncertainty about the degree of persistence. All in all, inflation persistence contributes to make the life of central bankers more difficult. One should be aware, however, that these are issues which are primarily relevant in the short term. Over medium- to longer horizons, monetary policy can deliver price stability, no matter what the degree of persistence and rigidities in the economy. Nevertheless, it could be that persistently high inflation may endanger the credibility of a central bank. Such a situation could arise, for example, in an environment characterised by a prolonged sequence of large inflationary shocks, which themselves may be persistent. This is something that has been observed in the euro area since the inception of Stage Three of EMU. If, under such circumstances, inflation remains above the level perceived as consistent with the central bank objective for an extended period, there is a risk that the public could start questioning the success of the central bank in maintaining price stability, and even its commitment to the price stability objective. In such a situation, economic agents could begin factoring into their expectations the possibility that the central bank objective is actually higher than it was thought to be. Or agents may start revising their beliefs on the policy horizon of the central bank in such a way that the return to price stability in the medium term will play a negligible role in expectations compared with the current level of inflation. A similar situation could arise if inflation is significantly below the price objective for a longer period, reflecting, for example, a clustering of downside shocks. What can and what should a central bank do to avoid such unfavourable effects on its credibility if inflation does not return to its target within an appropriate period of time? Our experience over the past few years has shown that three types of action are particularly important in this respect. First, it is crucial to identify the factors driving inflation and to explain their nature to the public in real time. For example, the oil price increase in 1999/2000, and the surge in oil prices over the course of this year, can generally be assessed as temporary shocks, but they may have been of a different nature. They were different in magnitude, particularly when measured in euro terms. Moreover, while the earlier increase may be assessed as predominantly supply-driven, the latter has been more a result of a combination of supply and demand-factors. This can make a difference as to how they affect the economy and also for the appropriate monetary policy response. Second, in terms of the conduct, but also the communication, of monetary policy, the central bank should make it clear that monetary policy is geared towards achieving price stability over the medium term and that it will take all actions necessary to deliver price stability over that horizon. In any event, central banks should not attempt to steer price developments in the short term. This also means clearly explaining to the public how monetary policy tailors its response to the nature and magnitude of the shocks hitting the economy. Specifically in the case of cost-push shocks, like the ones seen in the last few years, a more gradual monetary policy response might be required than in the case of demand shocks or shocks coming from labour cost developments. Third, we have continuously monitored inflation expectations and have remained ready to act on any sign of slippages in expectations. It is remarkable to note that even in the face of the substantial economic shocks I have just mentioned, long-term inflation expectations in the euro area have remained stable and well anchored at levels below 2% over the first few years of the euro. This means that the public has understood our assessment of the reasons behind a deviation of inflation from 2% and has remained convinced of the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance for ensuring price stability over the medium term. In any event, it is vital that the central bank understands the nature and degree of persistence. In this respect, it has to distinguish between inflation persistence arising intrinsically and the effects of persistent or repeated shocks on inflation. The degree of inflation persistence has major implications for the optimal conduct of monetary policy. Indeed, more recent evidence and analyses on this subject have reinforced the view that activism is detrimental to the efficacy of monetary policy. At the same time, theory suggests that in case of a higher degree of persistence in inflation, monetary policy may need to respond relatively more strongly to inflationary shocks, while eschewing activism. This, however, would be at the expense of higher output variability, implying higher real costs for the economy. Theoretical analyses have also addressed the problem of the robust design of monetary policy when there is uncertainty about the degree of persistence in the inflation process. The results of these studies suggest that it may be better for monetary policy-makers to work under the assumption of a high degree of inflation persistence because the costs of making a mistake when the inflation process is actually less persistent are not as high as they would be if the reverse were true. The recent literature also points out that the horizon over which price stability has to be restored depends on the nature of shocks and their interaction with the structural features that impinge upon inflation persistence. This endorses the view that monetary policy should not follow rigid rules in terms of the horizon for price stability or the extent of the monetary policy response on the basis of a few summary indicators. Instead, sound monetary policy relies on a comprehensive, real-time assessment of the shocks hitting the economy and the continuous monitoring of the structural relations governing the economy. Finally, the literature highlights the importance that monetary policy itself does not become a source of inflation persistence. Inflation expectations, which depend, inter alia, on the monetary policy strategy and its credibility, can be another important explanatory factor behind inflation persistence apart from stickiness in inflation or its determinants. This is why inflation persistence need not necessarily be an inherent feature of the economy, but can be also attributable to monetary policy itself. The credibility of the central bank is crucial in this regard. If the markets are uncertain in their perception of the actual inflation objective of the central bank, inflation tends to exhibit a high degree of persistence. This underlines the importance of giving clear signals in order to properly anchor inflation expectations; in this way, a credible policy regime that is focused on price stability will have the potential to reduce the persistence of inflation. This is also a key finding of the IPN: empirical estimates of inflation persistence fall significantly when accounting for shifts in the mean of inflation, which could be related to changes in the monetary policy regime. Inflation persistence in a heterogeneous currency area Another issue in this context is the question of differences in inflation persistence across sectors and countries of the euro area economy. The IPN reports that prices in the services sector across all countries are generally stickier than in other sectors, be it due to rigid wage developments or to the specific market structure with generally less severe competitiveness pressure. Moreover, there appears to be a quite substantial heterogeneity in inflation persistence across the euro area countries, although the results of the IPN are not conclusive with regard to the ranking of the countries in terms of the degree of persistence. It is an interesting, but open, question as to whether and how monetary policy should react to this. Should our monetary policy really pay more attention to the services sector, or the countries with a high degree of inflation persistence, as has been suggested by some research in this area? Or would this issue be better addressed by structural policies? Actually, Mundell, in his celebrated article on optimal currency areas, has already stressed the importance of flexible prices and particularly wages as one mechanism for helping to adjust to a new equilibrium following a shock in a monetary union. If inflation persistence plays a central role in amplifying and maintaining inflation differentials across countries, possibly due to differences in sectoral composition, structural policies aimed at increasing flexibility would help reduce the persistence of inflation differentials. Overall, monetary policy issues relating to heterogeneity in a currency union are very important, and I hope that the IPN will shed further light on them over the course of next year. In conclusion, the evidence emerging from the IPN project, but also from other sources, suggests that the degree of inflation persistence in the euro area should, in principle, not be a major factor hindering the conduct of a stability-oriented monetary policy in the short term. In any case, monetary policy will deliver price stability in the medium term and anchor inflation expectations. Experience indeed shows that we have anchored expectations in the past and will keep on doing so in the future. A smoother conduct of monetary policy may be facilitated by further implementation of structural reforms that may tend to reduce the degree of persistence in inflation. However, I do not want to be too persistent in speaking on inflation persistence. I will therefore conclude by thanking the members of the IPN for their hard and excellent work over the past couple of years. You have made a crucial contribution to the policy-making process and I am looking forward to your future work. Let me also thank all participants in this conference, in particular those who have presented or discussed a paper, for their valuable contributions which will help to further enhance the already outstanding work of the IPN. Last but not least, I would like to give special thanks to Iganzio Angeloni, the chairman of the IPN, for making this project a success.",0.0445962916040781,3.88630541941206,4.000553120931952,hawkish

Lane,,all_ECB_speeches.csv,"SPEECH Monetary policy in the euro area: the next phase Remarks for high-level panel “High Inflation and Other Challenges for Monetary Policy” by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Annual Meeting 2022 of the Central Bank Research Association (CEBRA), Barcelona Barcelona, 29 August 2022 The period December 2021 to July 2022 constituted a distinct first phase in the normalisation of the monetary policy of the ECB. Starting with the announcement that net purchases under the pandemic emergency programme (PEPP) would conclude in March 2022 and followed by the curtailment and the eventual cessation of net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) by the start of the third quarter, this phase was completed with the lifting of the key policy rates out of negative territory at the July meeting. This period saw a remarkable regime change in the behaviour of the euro area yield curve, with a very significant upward shift and an increase in volatility, as markets responded to the implications of the new inflation and cyclical environment for the future path for monetary policy, including the exit from “lower bound” monetary policy calibration. Having completed this initial stage of monetary policy normalisation, our upcoming September monetary policy meeting will be the start of a new phase. Our over-riding goal is to make sure that monetary policy will deliver the timely return of inflation to our medium-term two per cent target. In terms of execution, this new phase will consist of a meeting-by-meeting (MBM) approach to setting interest rates. At a basic level, the transition from rate forward guidance to the MBM approach is in line with our monetary policy strategy, which assessed that forward guidance was primarily an appropriate response to the lower bound constraint. As policy rates move away from the lower bound, the inherent flexibility of the MBM approach is better suited to calibrating monetary policy in a highly uncertain environment. Since monetary policy works through its influence on the entire yield curve, it is important to appreciate that MBM monetary policy essentially has two elements. First, it allows for meeting-by-meeting re-assessments of the conditionally-expected medium-term path for interest rates that is required to deliver the two per cent target, in line with the incoming data and evolving outlook. The terminal rate over the projection horizon is widely used as a short-hand summary indicator for the orientation of interest rate policy.[1] It follows that a primary influence on the interest rate decision in any one meeting is the size of the gap between the prevailing interest rate and the assessed terminal rate. Second, at a tactical level, the exact calibration of the interest rate decision should also take into account the appropriate speed to close that gap. Especially under conditions of high uncertainty, each of these factors can shift in a material way from one meeting to the next: first, there may be a revision in the projected terminal rate; and, second, the appropriate speed in closing the gap may accelerate or decelerate. To state the obvious, the current zero value of the policy rate (taking the deposit facility rate as the relevant policy rate in conditions of excess liquidity) is below any calculation of the appropriate terminal rate. Our July monetary policy statement signalled that further normalisation of interest rates will be appropriate: the scale and timeline of rate adjustment will be determined by the evolution of the terminal rate and the appropriate speed in closing the gap between the current rate and the terminal rate. In anticipation of further interest rate hikes towards the terminal rate, the euro area yield curve is much higher than the current policy rate, such that the extent of monetary tightening that has already occurred is far greater than the July first step in raising the policy rate. In assessing the terminal rate, both structural and cyclical factors are relevant. In the long-term steady state (with no shocks hitting the economy), the equilibrium nominal risk-free interest rate will be the sum of the two per cent inflation target and the long-term equilibrium risk-free real interest rate. However, within the medium-term horizon of monetary policy, time-varying cyclical factors may require interest rates to move above or below that long-term equilibrium level in order for inflation to stabilise at two per cent. It follows that, meeting-by-meeting, an important element of the monetary policy debate will be the discussion of our latest assessment of the appropriate terminal rate that takes into account the evolution of cyclical factors, in addition to assessing a potential role of structural forces in shifting the underlying long-term equilibrium real interest rate. In terms of understanding the interplay of cyclical factors, there are no shortcuts in following a data-dependent approach. It is essential to maintain an integrated analytical framework that jointly analyses the inflation cycle, the economic cycle and the financial cycle, in recognition of the interactions and inter-dependencies across economic, monetary and financial developments in determining the dynamics of nominal and real variables. This integrated framework is a cornerstone of our monetary policy strategy and guides the preparation of each monetary policy meeting, especially in the quarterly meetings in which new staff macroeconomic projections are presented together with comprehensive reports on monetary and financial developments. The over-riding focus of this analytical work is to make sure that monetary policy is calibrated to counter the cyclical forces that threaten the timely delivery of our two per cent inflation target. Let me highlight some of the major open questions about current cyclical conditions. The over-riding cyclical feature is that inflation is currently very far above the two per cent target, with the prospect of a prolonged phase before inflation returns to the neighbourhood of the target. In particular, inflation is expected to remain high in the near term primarily due to the further upward pressure on the costs for energy (especially gas and electricity) and food over the summer, together with the ongoing pass-through to retail prices of input cost increases incurred in the earlier stages of production chains. At a mechanical level, the combination of base effects, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the completion of the re-opening phase of the pandemic recovery will contribute to inflation falling back over time from its current extremely-high levels. However, the monetary policy challenge is to assess the strength and persistence of the cyclical adjustment dynamics to these high inflation rates that, if left unattended, could result in an unacceptably-delayed return to the two per cent inflation target, with the associated risk that inflation that remains too high for too long could de-anchor long-term inflation expectations. In particular, the wider economic cycle will play a critical role in determining the responses of price setters and wage setters to the currently-high inflation rates. Firms that have experienced declines in profit margins due to rising input costs and workers that have suffered a reduction in living standards due to the sharp increase in consumer prices will seek to restore the real value of their earnings and incomes. However, the wider economic cycle imposes constraints on the speed and the extent to which these adjustments can take place in a sustainable manner. In particular, a deterioration in the economic cycle would limit the capacity of firms to raise prices without suffering a loss of business and the capacity of workers to obtain wage increases without suffering a reduction in employment levels. The toll of unexpectedly-high inflation on real incomes and the real value of accumulated savings, the significant deterioration in the terms of trade (especially since so much energy is imported), the high intrinsic uncertainty associated with the Russian war on Ukraine (both in relation to energy and food costs and geo-political stability), the slowdown in the world economy and the tightening in global and domestic financial conditions that has already occurred all constitute significant economic headwinds for the euro area. At the same time, all else equal, the recovery in labour market conditions that has occurred should support faster nominal wage increases, as has already been evident (albeit only to a moderate extent) in the course of this year. Taken together, these forces suggest that cyclical inflation forces will be subject to push-pull dynamics. In one direction, the catch up adjustment of prices and wages to the steep cost increases that have already occurred constitutes a source of intrinsic persistence that, if excessive, could generate an unacceptable delay in the return of inflation to the two per cent target. In the other direction, the deterioration in the economic cycle will weaken the capacity of firms and workers to increase prices and wages in a sustainable manner. In turn, the meeting-by-meeting re-assessment of the appropriate terminal rate will reflect the implications of the incoming data for the relative strength of these opposing adjustment forces, together of course with the incidence of any further inflation shocks. Turning to the appropriate speed in closing the gap between the prevailing policy rate and the appropriate terminal rate, it is important to appreciate that the middle and longer segments of the yield curve, which are most important for determining financing conditions in the economy, are much more sensitive to the expected terminal rate than to the precise timeline for converging to the terminal rate. A steady pace (that is neither too slow nor too fast) in closing the gap to the terminal rate is important for several reasons. First, there is uncertainty about the transmission of policy rate changes to overall financing conditions, such that it makes sense to allow the financial system to absorb rate changes in a step-by-step manner. In particular, the same cumulative rate hike over a fixed interval is less likely to generate adverse feedback loops (that in turn could pose new risks to price stability) if it takes the form of a multi-step calibrated series rather than a smaller number of larger rate increases. Of course, in calibrating a multi-step series, the appropriate size of the individual increments will be larger the wider the gap to the terminal rate and the more skewed the risks to the inflation target. Second, the current high uncertainty about inflation dynamics and monetary policy transmission means that a multi-step adjustment path towards the terminal rate also makes it easier to undertake mid-course corrections if circumstances change. While upside risks to inflation are currently more intense than downside risks, if the incoming data (new shocks, updates on the relative strength of opposing adjustment forces) call for a downward shift in the terminal rate, this would be easier to handle under a step-by-step approach. Such risks not only include downside scenarios to the economic outlook but also external factors that could tighten financing conditions independently of domestic monetary policy actions (such as the spillover impact of monetary policy tightening in other countries or shifts in risk sentiment in global markets). For this reason, even if the general direction of monetary policy is shaped not only by the centre of the risk distribution but also by the current net upside skew, the agility to adjust the scale and speed of interest rate hikes remains vitally important. The incoming data on inflation expectations play an important role in our integrated assessment of economic, monetary and financial conditions. All sources — market-based data, the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA), the Consumer Expectations Survey (CES), the partial data on firm-level expectations from the Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS), the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) and national sources, the surveys of the European Commission, and a range of external surveys — are closely examined in relation to the formation of near-term, medium-term, and long-term inflation expectations. We also assess, where available, expectations about macroeconomic indicators (and the reported individual prospects of the surveyed households and firms). Even under scenarios in which long-term inflation expectations are firmly anchored, the evolution of near-term and medium-term inflation expectations and macroeconomic expectations play important roles in determining inflation and macroeconomic dynamics over these horizons. Clearly, the worst-case scenario would be characterised by the de-anchoring of long-term inflation expectations, which would be very costly to fix. Except under very artificial model specifications, inflation outcomes and macroeconomic outcomes will be important factors in determining inflation expectations and macroeconomic expectations, as individuals update their beliefs based on realised inflation and economic developments. By and large, the market-based indicators of inflation compensation and the expert surveys indicate that long-term inflation expectations remain close to the two per cent target, while near-term inflation expectations are quite elevated. In the CES, the medium-term inflation expectations of households also remain well below the near-term inflation expectations. Across all available sources, macroeconomic expectations (and prospects at the individual level) suggest a high degree of concern about a potential economic slowdown, a general recognition that supply shocks will generate both near-term inflation surges and a decline in the economic outlook, which in turn will constrain the persistence of inflation. This profile is consistent with a profile in which market participants, experts and households broadly understand (albeit to varying degrees) that supply shocks and temporary factors have pushed inflation up to the current high levels but that these factors are expected to fade over time, reinforced by the understanding that monetary policy actions (as captured by the expectations of substantial rate hikes in the coming months) will ensure the return of inflation to target. In terms of the feedback loop from inflation expectations to nominal and real dynamics, it is important to appreciate that, for any given nominal yield curve, if high near-time inflation expectations are accompanied by expectations of a deteriorated macroeconomic outlook and significant uncertainty then the inflation cycle is less likely to be amplified through an endogenous increase in consumption, investment and credit compared to an alternative scenario in which high near-term inflation expectations are accompanied by macroeconomic optimism. Put differently, cost-push inflation shocks are less likely to give rise to a pro-cyclical real interest rate channel compared to demand-driven inflation shocks. At the same time, market-based indicators of inflation risk and the right-tail of responses in the expert and household surveys also clearly show that the risk of inflation not returning to target in a timely manner is priced by market participants and feared by some survey respondents. As indicated in our recent monetary policy statements, such above-target revisions to some indicators of longer-term inflation expectations warrant close monitoring. In tracking these right-tail indicators, two conjectures are especially relevant. In one direction, more attentive traders, experts and individuals may identify more quickly a persistent shift in inflation dynamics, while inattentive participants adjust more slowly. Under such scenarios, as highlighted in the pioneering work of Ricardo Reis, right-tail measures will be leading indicators for a generalised revision in long-term inflation expectations.[2] However, under other scenarios, the right tail might be populated by those who over-react to high spot inflation readings and mis-perceive as permanent what turns out to be a temporary increase in the inflation rate. In these scenarios, the right-tail will not serve as an accurate leading indicator of generalised long-term inflation expectations.[3] Accordingly, the interpretation of right-tail measures is closely bound to the general analysis of the relative contribution of temporary and persistent forces in inflation dynamics. Finally, the meeting-by-meeting approach to monetary policy certainly poses communication challenges for central banks. Directional and qualitative communication about the gap between the current policy rate and the terminal rate can foster market dynamics that reinforce and underpin the desired monetary policy stance. However, it is debatable whether more quantitative signalling of the meeting-by-meeting assessment of the prevailing terminal rate is necessary or helpful. The open status of this issue is reflected in the range of approaches across central banks, from those that emphasise the value of reporting their expected future path of rate decisions to those (including the ECB) that just incorporate the observed market yield curve as an external benchmark. While, in principle, communicating the most likely path for future rate hikes could be an effective monetary policy tool, the potential downside is that it adds to the complexity of communications, especially if there are material revisions to the expected policy path from one meeting to the next. There are two clear communication priorities. First, especially when inflation is both high and expected to remain above target for an extended period, the central bank must provide the re-assurance that it has the capability and determination to deliver its price stability mandate. For the ECB, our symmetric two per cent inflation target provides a clear, unambiguous anchor and our monetary policy decisions should be forcefully explained as ensuring the delivery of our target over the medium term. Second, the highly uncertain environment means that, more than ever, the ECB should offer clear and comprehensive explanations of our meeting-by-meeting integrated assessments of the evolving outlook for economic, monetary and financial developments, with a particular focus in explaining how the incoming data are incorporated into our views on the central likelihoods and risk patterns for near-term and medium-term inflation dynamics and thereby shape our monetary policy decisions. While the terminal rate over the projection horizon will be different to the peak rate if a fairly-rapid descent from the peak rate is anticipated, for the purpose of these remarks, I will keep it simple by focusing on a scenario in which the peak rate and the terminal rate are the same over the projection horizon.

In light of the ongoing high inflation pressures, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Overall, the incoming information broadly supports the assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook that we formed at our previous meeting. Headline inflation has declined over recent months, but underlying price pressures remain strong. At the same time, our past rate increases are being transmitted forcefully to euro area financing and monetary conditions, while the lags and strength of transmission to the real economy remain uncertain.Our future decisions will ensure that the policy rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our policy rate decisions will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.The key ECB interest rates remain our primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance. In parallel, we will keep reducing the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio at a measured and predictable pace. In line with these principles, the Governing Council expects to discontinue the reinvestments under the APP as of July 2023.The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website.I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.Economic activityThe euro area economy grew by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, according to Eurostat’s preliminary flash estimate. Lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and fiscal policy support for firms and households have contributed to the resilience of the economy. At the same time, private domestic demand, especially consumption, is likely to have remained weak.Business and consumer confidence have recovered steadily in recent months but remain weaker than before Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people. We see a divergence across sectors of the economy. The manufacturing sector is working through a backlog of orders, but its prospects are worsening. The services sector is growing more strongly, especially owing to the reopening of the economy.Household incomes are benefiting from the strength of the labour market, with the unemployment rate falling to a new historical low of 6.5 per cent in March. Employment has continued to grow and total hours worked exceed pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the average number of hours worked remains somewhat below its pre-pandemic level and its recovery has stalled since mid-2022.As the energy crisis fades, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and in a concerted manner to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response. Fiscal policies should be oriented towards making our economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, can also help reduce price pressures in the medium term. In this regard, we welcome the publication of the European Commission’s legislative proposals for the reform of the EU’s economic governance framework, which should be concluded soon.InflationAccording to Eurostat’s flash estimate, inflation was 7.0 per cent in April, after having dropped from 8.5 per cent in February to 6.9 per cent in March. While base effects led to some increase in energy price inflation, from -0.9 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in April, the rate stands far below those recorded after the start of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Food price inflation remains elevated, however, standing at 13.6 per cent in April, after 15.5 per cent in March.Price pressures remain strong. Inflation excluding energy and food was 5.6 per cent in April, having edged down slightly compared with March to return to its February level. Non-energy industrial goods inflation fell to 6.2 per cent in April, from 6.6 per cent in March, when it declined for the first time in several months. But services inflation increased to 5.2 per cent in April, from 5.1 per cent in March. Inflation is still being pushed up by the gradual pass-through of past energy cost increases and supply bottlenecks. In services, especially, it is still being pushed higher also by pent-up demand from the reopening of the economy and by rising wages. The information available up to March suggests that indicators of underlying inflation remain high.Wage pressures have strengthened further as employees, in a context of a robust labour market, recoup some of the purchasing power they have lost as a result of high inflation. Moreover, in some sectors firms have been able to increase their profit margins on the back of mismatches between supply and demand and the uncertainty created by high and volatile inflation. Although most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, some indicators have edged up and warrant continued monitoring.Risk assessment Renewed financial market tensions, if persistent, would pose a downside risk to the outlook for growth as they could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampen confidence. Russia’s war against Ukraine also continues to be a significant downside risk to the economy. However, the recent reversal of past adverse supply shocks, if sustained, could spur confidence and support higher growth than currently expected. The continued resilience of the labour market, by bolstering household confidence and spending, could also lead to higher growth than anticipated. There are still significant upside risks to the inflation outlook. These include existing pipeline pressures that could send retail prices higher than expected in the near term. Moreover, Russia’s war against Ukraine could again push up the costs of energy and food. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. Recent negotiated wage agreements have added to the upside risks to inflation, especially if profit margins remain high. The downside risks include renewed financial market tensions, which could bring inflation down faster than projected. Weaker demand, due for example to a more marked slowing of bank lending or a stronger transmission of monetary policy, would also lead to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.Financial and monetary conditionsThe euro area banking sector has proved resilient in the face of the financial market tensions that arose ahead of our last meeting. Our policy rate increases are being transmitted strongly to risk-free interest rates and to the financing conditions for firms, households and banks. For firms and households, loan growth has weakened owing to higher borrowing rates, tighter credit supply conditions and lower demand. Our latest bank lending survey reported a tightening of overall credit standards, which was stronger than banks had expected in the previous round and suggests that lending may weaken further. Weak lending has meant that money growth has also continued to decline.Conclusion Summing up, the inflation outlook continues to be too high for too long. In light of the ongoing high inflation pressures, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Overall, the incoming information broadly supports the assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook that we formed at our previous meeting. Headline inflation has declined over recent months, but underlying price pressures remain strong. At the same time, our past rate increases are being transmitted forcefully to euro area financing and monetary conditions, while the lags and strength of transmission to the real economy remain uncertain.Our future decisions will ensure that the policy rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our policy rate decisions will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission.We are now ready to take your questions.* * *My first question would be on the rationale behind the reduced pace in the interest rate hike of 25 basis points – why did you come up with that? My second question goes to the US regional lender banking crisis, which isn’t over yet. How concerned are you about potential spillover effects to the euro area? Thank you for your question. I will take the first and ask my colleague and friend Vice-President Luis de Guindos to address the second one. So let me tell you a little bit about the mood in the room of the Governing Council. I would characterise the mood as determined – all governors are determined to fight inflation, tame inflation and return it to 2% over the medium term. And we all concluded, as you have seen, that the inflation outlook is too high and has been so for too long. I would say then that the mood was very focused and yet, it is an in-between-projections Governing Council meeting. But we were extremely attentive to all data that was available to us and obviously one case in point is the Bank Lending Survey that you all received or saw on Tuesday when it was published and which contains a lot of intelligence and information about the intention and the comparison between the lending practices and standards with what was expected by the banks. I’m happy to come back to that later, but it explains obviously the decision that we made for this 25 basis point increase. I think in terms of method, we were method-dependent in many ways just as we are data-dependent, because we have articulated the reaction function of our monetary policy decisions, with the three key elements of the inflation outlook informed by the financial and economic data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. So we checked all the data that we had against these three criteria. And as is always the case at the Governing Council meeting, there were a variety of views expressed and I think that it’s fair to say that everybody agreed that increasing rates was necessary; that second, we are not pausing, that’s very clear, and, third, we know that we have more ground to cover on the basis of the baseline that we had, which is still guiding us until we have our next projection exercise, and on the basis of the data that we have received in the course of the last few days and that we brought together during the meeting. I think the ultimate balancing act, which received almost unanimous support and that is reflected in the monetary policy statement in front of you, was really predicated on the methods, the data we received, and the understanding that where we are is totally consistent with the baseline that we had for the outlook last time around. Remember, at the last March meeting that’s what I said. And second, that underlying inflation is still high and third, informed by the bank lending survey and the data that we have concerning interest rates, which is a little bit outdated because it goes back to February, the transmission of our monetary policy is working at least [with regards] to the financing leg and we are not yet certain about the next leg, which is transmission from banks to the real economy. So it’s on the basis of all that, that we made our decision. Now that we have increased rates significantly and sometimes by very large increments, establishing absolute credibility on our determination, it was sensible, in view of what I have told you, to return to a more standard increment, with the understanding that, based on the information we have today, we have more ground to cover and we are not pausing – that’s extremely clear. De Guindos: Turning to your second question, I think that we should start with a consideration: if you look at the characteristics of the US banks that are running into difficulties, I think that there are some common features. The first one is that they are medium-sized, regional, they share very concrete and very idiosyncratic business models, and they are quite open to interest rate risks – they are vulnerable to an increase in yields. And I think that this model, this situation is not extrapolatable to the European banking industry. I will not repeat what we have said many times – that European banks are resilient [because of] their levels of capital, levels of liquidity and quality of the liquid assets – but I think that simultaneously, we have to remember that an increase in interest rates, in yields, is positive for the European banks because the increase in margins outweighs the potential losses that this increase in yields could cause in fixed-income portfolios. But I think that it is quite clear that there is no space for complacency. One of the things that we – all of us – have been surprised about is how rapidly a bank run can take place and how rapidly a bank can be emptied. And I think that this is the combination of new factors. The first one is digital banking and the second one is social networks. The combination of both have even led to a new situation. I think that as supervisors and regulators we have to bear in mind this new framework because we believe that this is going to be key in the near future. My first question is about whether anyone at the meeting insisted on a larger rate hike or on a clearer commitment to more hikes. You just hinted at that by talking about “ground to cover” but it wasn’t quite as explicit as it was back in the winter when you were talking about “steady pace” and “several rate hikes”. My second question is about something you just said, which is again that you had “more ground to cover”. Would you say that we are still in the middle of the journey or towards the end, in the home stretch? I’m tempted to remind you of the Emerson quote, “it’s not so much the destination that matters but the journey”, and we are on a journey and we are not pausing. Under the present circumstances and based on what we have, which is the baseline of March, we know that we have more ground to cover. There is a clear reference in the second paragraph of the Monetary Policy Statement [in which] we explicitly refer to that by saying that our future decisions will ensure that the policy rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. We covered a lot of ground in the last nine months [prior to today’s meeting], moving from minus 50 basis points to plus 300 basis points. We are continuing this hiking process. As I said, this is a journey. We have not arrived yet. As to the exact amount, by how much we increase rates, as I said in my introduction in the response to the first questions, there were a variety of views. Some governors suggested that maybe 50 [basis points] was appropriate, others believed that 25 was appropriate. I didn’t hear anybody suggest that zero would be appropriate, which confirms to you that this is a hiking journey that we are on and it will continue to be so. But at the end of the deliberations and having had a chance to confront our views and answer the questions and really put everything in perspective, there was a general and very strong consensus behind the decision that you have in front of you. I would like to invite you to elaborate a little bit more on your definition of “sufficiently restrictive”. The IMF had a view the other day, seeing the terminal rate at 3.75%. A lot of economists believe that as well. Would that be something – given the inflation outlook we have at the moment – that would be in the ballpark of “sufficiently restrictive”? The other question I have is that at the last meeting you had a little bit of a debate about over-tightening and having to reverse course. I’m wondering whether that discussion continued this time and whether you would actually be worried that such a scenario might be interpreted as a policy mistake. I don’t have a magic number of what constitutes “sufficiently restrictive”. I think that the honest answer is that we will know what that is when we get there and we are in the process of moving into that direction. I think what’s important is to understand what it means to have restrictive rates and to be in restrictive territory. I think the best example is to see whether the rate decisions that we make, the rate increases that we decide, are actually having an impact on the economic actors. And when we look at the Bank Lending Survey or when we look at the interest rates and the pace at which they have increased over the last few months, it is obviously the fact that interest rate decisions that we made and the interest rates level we are on are having an effect. Is it a sufficient effect yet? We don’t know because we are not seeing the transmission at this point in time into what I call the second leg of the economy, which is the real activity, which then has an impact on prices and then reduces inflation. The full cycle we are not seeing yet. We are seeing inflation coming down, don’t get me wrong, because headline is coming down as a result of energy prices having come down significantly, as a result of the easing of bottlenecks. But we are not yet seeing the complete impact that we desire in order to arrive at the 2% medium term that constitutes our target. We are very attentive, we look at that, as you know it’s one of the three components that we look at, the inflation outlook. Is it restrictive? No question about it. Is it sufficiently restrictive? Not yet. I have two questions. The first one is on the decision to accelerate the pace of shrinking the bond portfolio of the ECB. Does that mean, now that you’re stopping all reinvestments in the APP, that you plan to reduce the APP to zero eventually? The second question: was this decision part of a compromise deal to convince those arguing for a 50 basis point move to accept a 25 basis point move in return for accelerating the pace of shrinking your balance sheet? Number one, we made the decision but the decision specifically says “we expect”. So we expect to let the APP run down as time goes by. In answer to your question about whether we go to zero: if we do, then it’s going to take [at least] the next 15 years, so I don’t think I’ll be around for that, I know I won’t, and I’m not sure that you will be around either. But the ultimate perspective is that one, as we consider things today. We’ve decided to expect the effectiveness of the decision as of July, saving a little bit of optionality just in case, simply because we have seen that the partial reinvestment that has been effective since March has actually run very smoothly and has been well-absorbed by markets. We don’t see any point in not accelerating the move because there are valid reasons for [doing] that: it lowers the amount of excess liquidity, complements our policy rate, reduces the side effect of a large balance sheet – all of that completely justifies the fact that the APP is let to run down gradually over the course of time, which will be an average of 25 billion per month that will not be reinvested, roughly. But as I said, running the whole APP programme to zero will take [longer than] 12-15 years, given the maturities we have. I would just reserve one thing, because we discussed it during the Governing Council and it’s not reflected in the Monetary Policy Statement. As you know, we have adopted a tilting approach to our reinvestment policy of the APP and in particular for the corporate bonds, which are the prime targets of that tilting, in order to privilege those corporates that have a good environmental footprint, that have a transition plan and that disclose all the appropriate information about their plans. Of course if we go to full run-down, that tilting process is not going to be applicable because there will be nothing to tilt it off, there will be no basis for that. The jury is out as to how we can continue to deliver on our Paris agreement compliant investment and reinvestment programme without the reinvestment phase and how we address that, which is something that we agreed we would take into account and consider to see how we respond to that. Was it a deal? No. There was a general view that that was the right move, completely sensible, legitimate at this point in time given the market absorption. Some might have preferred to wait until the June meeting to announce it, given that it’s effective as of 1 of July. But with the principle of predictability that we had agreed in the first place, we thought it was just better off to just announce it with reserving a little optionality on the side. About the last banking lending survey, is there a target for bank lending or limits in credit tightening or do you monitor these indicators?Second question: you said recently in relation to bank failures on the Credit Suisse case that you really need to measure what comes out of these financial events. What are the indicators that you’re looking at? Would you say that there is a banking crisis? What’s your view of what’s happening there in the banking system? We know of one and only one target and this is our medium-term target of 2%. That’s what is riveting our attention. But of course the Bank Lending Survey that we receive on a quarterly basis informs us about the tightening of credit to the economy, and it also informs us about what the banks assess will be or will not be the tightening. It’s quite a sophisticated survey which is really for information, intelligence, anticipation of the credit tightening now and the credit tightening going forward. It’s also illustrative of the demand and that’s an interesting point because in the Bank Lending Survey, the demand from corporates is really, really down. So that’s a learning we take, which indicates that our interest rate policy is beginning to have an impact, because, when asked, the corporates – and we had a corporate survey conducted – say “it’s the interest rates, it’s not that we don’t want to invest but the interest rates are pretty high”. And that [brings us back to the question of] restrictive territory or not: yes, we are in restrictive territory because if that is the response of corporates, then it shows that [our policy] has worked. On Credit Suisse, number one, it was addressed very swiftly. The Swiss authorities maybe did not have many choices and it was very specific and probably a long-lasting issue that was lingering and had been lingering for a long time. I certainly would not draw the conclusion that the merger between UBS and Credit Suisse to be decided is an indication that there is a financial crisis, far from it. But we are learning. I think that we also learnt the value of having rules and the ability we had to come out very quickly on the pecking order of creditors actually mattered a lot and I think we can also take a bit of learning from that. When creditors and investors know exactly who is going to bear the brunt of outstanding liabilities in a situation of insolvency, it just helps. And we did that, I’m glad we did. De Guindos: On the question about the indicators that we consider, that we look at: we have a range of indicators, for instance equity prices, bank bond spreads, the evolution of deposits. We have not seen the kind of situations that happened in other jurisdictions. We had an increase in tensions after the events in the US with Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse. Afterwards, the situation has been quite calm. We are continuously looking at those indicators but, clearly, now the conclusion is that the European banking industry has been clearly outperforming the American one in terms of the tension [reflected] in these kinds of indicators and potential stress in financial markets. Can you explain how you reconcile your data dependency with the pledge of doing more in the future? It can be a little bit contradictory, like forward guidance without the forward guidance. Maybe you can explain it a little bit more. Secondly, on core inflation, no doubt it is important to monitor core inflation, but the ECB’s target, as you have said just now, is headline inflation at 2% in the medium term. So how do you explain such a great emphasis on core inflation, also considering that core inflation has not been a good leading indicator for headline inflation in the past? Data dependency is not forward guidance, and I’ll try to explain that to you for a second. I’m not giving you the forward guidance that “come what may” or “subject to” or “until such time we will do this or that.” That for me would be forward guidance. We had it in the past and it was very appropriate to have forward guidance as we were at the lower bound, and that was a tool that was very useful. What I’m telling you now is given our baseline, the findings that we have, the data that we can analyse today, our judgement in the room is that we are not pausing, that applies to today, based on what we see we determine that we have more ground to cover. I’m not saying that in the abstract, I’m saying that with reference to the baseline of March, to what we are seeing in development and I’m here saying we believe that we have more ground to cover. It is not state-dependent, it is not time-dependent, it is a judgement that we make today. So I hope I have been clear to try to explain to you how we can actually say that very firmly without giving forward guidance and being data-dependent. Come the June meeting, come the July meeting, come the September meeting and so on and so forth, we will look at the data and we will use the three criteria of our reaction function for monetary policy purposes and we will make our decision on a meeting-by-meeting basis. You’ve also asked me another question about core [inflation]. We had long discussions about core [inflation], and we actually had many more discussions on underlying inflation, because core is interesting, core is easy to communicate. You take headline, the whole basket of everything that’s in the index, you take out food, you take out anything having to do with energy and you have core. But we want to go a little bit deeper into the index and the evolution that we see and we have multiple measurements that you are familiar with, you know the trimmed mean, the PCCI [Persistent and Common Component of Inflation], the PCCI excluding energy and so on and so forth. We look at all of those and we try to understand from the evolution that we see what is the likelihood of inflation evolution. So, I’m not maybe addressing your core versus headline question but I’m simply saying that headline is the objective that we have, it’s the target that we have, that we’ve agreed in our strategy review. It happens to be what matters to people. People see all prices increasing and we are working for the people of Europe. Core, easy to communicate but maybe not as informative as we want it to be, so that leads us to dissect, in far more details, inflation. Madame Lagarde. I’m sure many people will be interested to know whether the worst of inflation is over for food. Do you have that impression? Thank you for that question because it is food prices that are hurting most, particularly the most vulnerable people. We know that because in the basket of consumption the most vulnerable spend a lot more on food than those who are well-off. So we pay special attention of course to food and the increase in prices. We have seen it go down, if you compare March and April numbers it is going down, but we have to be extremely attentive because there are multiple factors that apply to food prices, that apply to processed food prices. I think we have also flagged the fact that profits last year and particularly in 2022 have contributed to inflation. This year, 2023, what we have seen of 2023, we see more wage increases contributing to inflation. We would hope that through a good social contract, these drivers of inflation do not activate each other in what I have called in other places a tit-for-tat – I want more wages, I’m not going to give up on profits – and you are then at risk of something that is much more difficult and would lead us to have to take more active measures in monetary policy. So, I wish I could tell you “of course it will continue to go down” but I’m observing that it has gone down. There are other factors that will come into play, you know, clearly climate change is something that will have an impact probably on a sectoral basis, probably in relation to certain food items. What happens in Ukraine is also going to bring another uncertainty in the background of cereal price in particular, but commodity prices have gone down, that is a fact. So hopefully it will channel to the ultimate consumer. Can the ECB continue hiking if the Federal Reserve stops, is that a baseline scenario you are working on? And second question, do you have any estimates on how much tightening the QT and the TLTRO maturity is adding to the monetary policy stance? Can you perhaps phrase it in hiking or basis points of hikes? You know I’ve heard the fiscal dependency, I’ve heard the finance dependency, I had not heard the Fed dependency. The ECB is an independent central bank, looks at what others do around the world, from New Zealand, which has been an interesting innovator in the field of monetary policy, all the way to the Fed and others. And it’s obvious that the US economy, in whichever way it evolves, has spillover effects around the world given its size, the depth of its financial markets. But you know we have a target, we have a journey, we know as of today that we have more ground to cover and whatever the decision of the Fed is in the next few weeks, months, we are going to be riveted to our objective and will of course take into account variables. You know the currency for instance has an impact, any spillovers will be taken into account, but we are not Fed-dependent in that respect. As to the actual tightening impact that the APP run-off has, I don’t want to commit a number, but it does not have a massive impact suffice to say, but we can give you separately the exact amount that has been calculated, but it’s not material. You have repeated that the journey continues and you are not pausing. There are many households in Finland, Lithuania, Spain that struggle with the much higher interest rates and have had to cut down on their spending, so how do you take them into account when hiking interest rates? And then a second one, what should they prepare themselves for, what can you say to them about the future, when can we see the policy rates going down, and maybe affecting also the 12 month Euribor? Thank you. So, of course we are aware of these households that have contracted loans with floating rates, variable rates, whatever you call it, and from Finland to Portugal, from some of the Baltic countries to Spain, it is the case that some families are hurting because the reimbursements that they have to honour have gone up as a result of the interest rate increases that we had to decide. This is unfortunately not something that we can alleviate or attenuate because our task is price stability, our task is to reduce inflation and the tools of choice that work in that respect is the interest rates and we have to use that interest rate. Some countries are taking particular steps and measures and some financial institutions are also looking at offering moratoria or delays. I think that the best we can do is to really tame inflation in a timely manner, meaning as fast as we can, in order to then facilitate a return to different interest rates that would not be as high in the future. And I’m not here making any commitment to cut at any point in time, thank you very much. You will travel next week to Japan for the G7 meeting. What kind of topics do you want to bring at this upcoming meeting from a European point of view? Thank you for giving us that angle from the East. You know I would hope that, together with my European colleagues, we can, one, learn from colleagues, particularly Japan, which is moving into a new direction with a new governor. So anything that will be the Japanese monetary policy going forward and any understanding that we have of their strategy review, which he has announced, will be of interest. I would be very happy to share with him the learnings from our strategy review which I had started when I took the job. I would also hope that we can explain to colleagues from Canada, Japan and the United States that the Europeans together are going to continue to demonstrate resilience, capacity to operate together. And I would hope that in that respect something that we say in the statement here will resonate, which is to agree on the fiscal governance in short order, so that in addition to having a monetary policy that is common to 20 countries, we also have a fiscal framework which gives governance to the 27 member states. And that fiscal policies that are determined by member states are also focused on value for money, for lack of a better word, in other words putting in place the right reforms, focusing the spending where it is going to increase the competitiveness and the efficiency of the economy which is something that is absolutely indispensable in order to have this social contract which is often associated with Europe. If I may go back to quantitative tightening, just to understand whether there is more ground to cover on QT or whether with this end of reinvestments on APP this is the end of QT? There could be more to be done with PEPP for example, starting on pandemic or selling bonds to make it even quicker, so this also helps to understand how important QT is as a restrictive monetary policy tool. And my second question, if I may, is on TLTROs, because even if the European banking system is solid and resilient and the banking crisis from the US could be over, we hope, still our TLTROs are going to end in an odd moment. Are you concerned or are you confident the banks can give back 500 billion in June and get away with it? On QT let me be very clear, QT is the decision that we expect to implement as of 1 July concerns APP reinvestments only and nothing else. We have forward guidance on PEPP reinvestment, nothing until 2024. You will find, I think in the annex to my statement, a reference to the PEPP and to the principle of flexibility, which we believe is an important key aspect of PEPP going forward. So those tools are intact, we are not planning on not reinvesting anything that comes for redemption under the PEPP agreement. On TLTRO, there is no surprise about TLTRO. If anything, we have managed to offer the possibility for banks to accelerate and anticipate the reimbursement, which I think has avoided a cliff effect, that we would have had, over a trillion euros would have become outstanding in June. Thanks to the accelerated reimbursement we are now down to 477 billion, I’m checking the numbers because I want to be clear on that. So it’s not a surprise, it’s a come due date and reimbursements are due and I know that banks have prepared for it and that there is a lot of liquidity out there to continue to prepare. Having said that, you know it wouldn’t surprise me if some of the facilities that we have that are standing facilities – liquidity windows that are available, full allotment and rates that are well-known to all – would be used again, because that’s a perfectly normal job of a central bank to actually provide liquidity. You know we have weekly, we have the LTRO, three months, full allotment on all those liquidity facilities and if anything was to happen we have demonstrated in the past that we can be inventive.",0.0500503917101286,4.429456777410004,3.879956978374344,hawkish
8edd3f7e88ee3347dceb91d6e1f426cce45ee218,2022-11-03,speech,Mind the step: calibrating monetary policy in a volatile environment,Fabio Panetta,,all_ECB_speeches.csv,"SPEECH Mind the step: calibrating monetary policy in a volatile environment Keynote speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ECB Money Market Conference Frankfurt am Main, 3 November 2022 The euro area is facing a sequence of unprecedented supply shocks resulting from the pandemic and Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. These shocks have compounded each other and caused the current spike in inflation. Price pressures have broadened as firms have sought to pass higher costs on to consumers as the economy reopened. As a result, the ECB has accelerated the adjustment of monetary policy to keep inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with its target. Across the last three Governing Council meetings, we have increased our interest rates by 200 basis points. This is the fastest rate hike in the ECB’s history. Looking ahead, the medium-term inflation outlook presents clear upside risks in a general context of extraordinary uncertainty about the future evolution of the European economy. Today I will argue that, at present, the direction of monetary policy is clear. A further policy adjustment is warranted in order to keep inflation expectations anchored and stave off second-round effects. However, the calibration of our stance should not rely on a one-sided view of risks − especially as we continue normalising our monetary policy in a highly uncertain economic environment. And it should remain focused on medium-term inflationary developments . We need to bring inflation back to our 2% target as soon as possible, but not sooner. We might otherwise create unintended effects, achieving little reduction of inflation in the short term, but causing excessive market volatility and a protracted economic slowdown beyond what is necessary to stabilise inflation in the medium term. Implementing the correct calibration of monetary policy will be challenging. We will need to carefully consider the resilience of our economy, the implications of global monetary spillovers, and emerging threats to financial stability. Trade-offs in setting the appropriate monetary policy stance In the current situation, the direction of our monetary policy is clear. Inflation in the euro area is too high and will remain above our target for an extended period. Headline inflation reached 10.7% in October. Core inflation is around 5%.[1] Monetary policy normalisation is necessary when repeated supply shocks drive inflation higher for longer.[2] It signals that the central bank will not tolerate a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, reducing the likelihood of such a de-anchoring occurring. And it guards against the risk that monetary policy could exacerbate inflationary pressures by stimulating demand.[3] But while the direction of the adjustment is clear, its calibration is not and its end point depends on the evolving medium-term economic and inflation outlook. The neutral interest rate provides limited guidance here. It is an asymptotic concept that describes the point when interest rates are neither accommodative nor contractionary in a situation where growth is around potential, inflation is not far from target and no transitory shocks are disrupting the inflation path. But that is not the world in which we find ourselves. Moreover, the neutral rate is unobservable. As I have argued elsewhere,[4] estimates of the neutral rate are imprecise and widely dispersed. They are subject to considerable uncertainty in a post-pandemic world that has undergone structural change.[5] Today, I find it more helpful to discuss the target-consistent terminal rate. This is the level of the policy rate that − if reached at the end of a short normalisation phase and then held constant − stabilises inflation at target by the end of the policy-relevant horizon in the absence of new shocks. I prefer the concept of the target-consistent rate to that of the neutral rate because it emphasises that we can gear our policy to a clear state-contingent reference in order to bring inflation back to target within a clearly defined period. Eurosystem staff regularly calculate estimates of the target-consistent terminal rate, which are an input into the preparation of our monetary policy meetings.[6] But let me stress that these estimates are conditional on the economic and inflation outlook. They need to be continually reassessed in the light of incoming information. Specifically, we need to navigate a complex set of risks to medium-term inflation. On the upside, we could face the emergence of what I have called “ugly” inflation.[7] This arises when above-target inflation de-anchors expectations, causing excessive wage and price-setting dynamics that eventually fuel further inflation increases (the second-round effects). At present, this risk is mostly driven by high energy prices and their pass-through to prices of other items. Annual energy inflation is running at around 42%. Energy has been the main contributor to headline inflation for the past 18 months (Chart 1). Higher energy input costs have contributed to extraordinarily high food inflation. They have been a key driver of goods and services inflation (Chart 2). And by dragging down the trade balance and weighing on the economic outlook, they are contributing to the depreciation of the euro, further reinforcing inflationary pressures (Chart 3).

So far, inflation expectations have remained anchored and the risk of an incipient wage-price spiral in the euro area has been contained. Nominal negotiated wage growth has ticked up recently but is still far from compensating for the drop in real incomes caused by higher inflation.[8] And the outlook for wage growth and unit labour costs remains consistent with our target overall.[9] But we need to remain extremely vigilant in view of prolonged high inflation, which increases the likelihood of a pass-through to wage growth[10], especially as labour markets are now tighter than before the pandemic. But other forces may increasingly push in the opposite direction and contain the risk of second-round effects, as what I have dubbed “bad” inflation – the inflation resulting from supply shocks – compresses real incomes. The reduction in real wages and purchasing power is weakening domestic demand, with several leading indicators already pointing to a likely contraction in economic activity, starting from the last quarter of this year. The euro area PMI composite output index fell in October to its lowest level since November 2020,[11] with forward-looking indicators of activity particularly weak.[12] Consumer confidence plummeted to historical lows.[13] And financial and credit indicators also point to significant downside risks to GDP growth (Chart 4).[14] Chart 4 Downside risks to euro area real GDP growth Lower tail of the distribution of real GDP growth forecasts for Q1 and Q3 2023 based on “GDP-at-risk” models (quarter-on-quarter change in percentage points) Source: ECB calculations. Notes: For each horizon, the chart shows the median of estimates of the lower quantile (10th percentile) forecast across the suite of “GDP-at-risk” models maintained by ECB staff, as well as the interquartile range to account for model uncertainty. These estimates are predicated mainly on developments in financial conditions, credit, risk, and the macroeconomy. Forecasts are conditional on financial data up to mid-October 2022 and real economy indicators up to the end of September 2022. These forces pushing on the downside might be reduced if supply bottlenecks continue to ease (Chart 5) and energy commodity and electricity prices continue to fall from their highs (Chart 6).[15] But this would then also improve the inflation outlook and reduce the likelihood of “ugly” inflation taking hold.

Note: The latest observation is for October 2022. To sum up, the implementation of monetary policy presents us with a difficult trade-off. On the one hand, our need to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored speaks for targeting the upper part of the range of estimates of the target-consistent terminal rate. And this range would move higher if upside risks to medium-term inflation materialised. But, on the other hand, in setting the monetary policy response we need to keep basing our decisions on the latest evidence and factor in downside risks to the economic outlook. Policy normalisation, transmission lags and global spillovers In recent months, the public debate has stressed the risks of doing too little to curb inflation, since this would require a more painful future adjustment. But this should not make us underappreciate the risk of doing too much. First, we should bear in mind that it takes time before the full impact of our measures is felt in the economy.[16] Moreover, monetary policy is transmitted to different variables with different lags. It immediately affects market expectations and financial market conditions through bond yields, equity prices and exchange rates. Since we started normalising monetary policy at the end of 2021, the one-year forward real rates have moved significantly higher across the entire term structure (Chart 7) and the one-year forward real rate one year ahead is now in positive territory. Likewise, nominal and real ten-year rates have increased by around 300 and 250 basis points respectively (Chart 8) . Chart 7 Change in euro area forward real interest rates (percentage points) Sources: Bloomberg, Refinitiv and ECB calculations. Notes: Real forward rates are calculated by subtracting the inflation-linked swap forward rates from the nominal overnight index swap forward rates for each maturity. The latest observation is for 20 October 2022. Chart 8 Ten-year real, nominal and inflation-linked swap rates for the euro area (percentages per annum) Sources: Refinitiv and ECB calculations. Note: The latest observation is for 20 October 2022. Crucially, however, it takes longer for our decisions to be transmitted to the real economy through changes in lending conditions and, subsequently, demand and prices. The debate should thus not be distorted by an excessive focus on short-run inflationary developments, which cannot be controlled by monetary policy. The full impact of our measures will likely reach the economy when activity and inflation are already on a declining path.[17] This implies that our tightening will need to end when inflation is still above our target. Second, we need to factor in global monetary policy spillovers when defining the domestic stance. With central banks across advanced economies adjusting their policies simultaneously (Chart 9), they could accentuate each other’s policy impacts if they do not sufficiently factor in the feedback loop they create.[18] ECB analysis finds that a tightening by the Federal Reserve System generates spillovers to euro area real activity and inflation that are comparable to its effects on the US economy.[19] Chart 9 Financial conditions indices in advanced economies and emerging market economies (standardised indices) Sources: Refinitiv, Bloomberg and ECB staff calculations. Notes: National financial conditions indices are aggregated using GDP purchasing power parity shares. The latest observations are for 6 October 2022. It is sometimes argued that domestic inflation having a large global component should mean that domestic monetary policy needs to be tightened more forcefully to compensate for this weakened grip on prices. But if central banks across advanced economies are simultaneously tightening monetary policy – as is the case today – the opposite is true.[20] If central banks do not fully factor in the effects of other central banks’ policies, the current phase of global adjustment may give way to a more severe slowdown than anticipated. In recent decades, episodes of highly synchronised global monetary policy tightening have been associated with subsequent global recessions (Chart 10). Chart 10 Inflation surges, tightening synchronisation and global recessions (percentages of countries) Sources: ECB calculations, BIS data and Haver Analytics. Notes: The global “inflation surges” index (red dashed line) shows the share of countries which, at time t, are simultaneously experiencing: (1) year-on-year inflation that is higher than at time t-1; and (2) year-on-year inflation that is above a certain threshold. In this case, the threshold is given by the average of the year-on-year inflation in the post-Volcker period, from the first quarter of 1984 to the second quarter of 2022. The global “tightening synchronisation” index (blue solid line) is constructed using BIS data on the policy rates set by central banks and shows the share of countries which are tightening at time t. Global recessions are periods when: (1) annual growth of global GDP per capita is negative or close to zero; and (2) a high share of countries are in a technical recession. The latest observations are for the second quarter of 2022. Such a scenario could have particularly negative implications for the euro area. Our economy is not only more vulnerable than others to the energy crisis, it is also more open than economies such as the United States, China and Japan, and thus more exposed to a global recession. And because it is less flexible than the US economy, reversing course may be more difficult if demand and production weaken too much.[21] Avoiding unintended effects in a volatile market environment Incorrectly calibrating our monetary policy could also have unintended effects for financial stability and the transmission of our monetary policy. The highly uncertain outlook has increased the sensitivity of market rates to new developments and shifts in risk sentiment. In turn, higher rates are exacerbating risk aversion, exposing the vulnerabilities of certain highly leveraged segments – such as residential property markets[22] – and some types of non-bank financial intermediaries[23]. These segments are vulnerable to adverse loops, with falling prices and rising rates feeding into higher debt refinancing costs, especially as falling real incomes make those costs less affordable. This market volatility is being compounded by global financial spillovers (Chart 11). These come mainly from the United States[24], but were also visible in the reaction of euro-denominated yields to the recent episode of market repricing in the United Kingdom. Chart 11 Global component in yields Correlation of sovereign bond yields in advanced economies, expectations components and term premia (correlation coefficient) Sources: Datastream and Haver Analytics. Notes: The sample consists of ten advanced economies (Australia, Canada, Denmark, euro area, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States). The bilateral correlation coefficients are averaged across these countries and time periods. The term premia and expectations components are the average of estimates from three models (dynamic Nelson-Siegel, rotated dynamic Nelson-Siegel and dynamic Svensson-Soderlind). The latest observations are for 21 October 2022 (daily data). In the euro area, an additional source of volatility is the risk of financial fragmentation along national lines, which can impair the homogenous transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area. The current environment therefore requires us to be prudent in adjusting our monetary policy across all instruments. There are three key considerations here. First, our decisions and communication on the pace of normalisation should avoid amplifying market volatility. There is a case for frontloading our policy adjustment given the need to keep expectations anchored, especially in view of the very accommodative stance from which normalisation started. But such frontloading should remain commensurate to the benefits and risks it creates. When it comes to managing inflation expectations, ECB staff analysis finds that the benefits of surprising markets with bigger-than-expected rate increases is limited in the euro area.[25] And if these bigger-than-expected increases are interpreted as signalling a higher terminal rate, rather than simply frontloading the normalisation, we could have a stronger impact on financing conditions – and ultimately on economic activity – than intended. Additionally, a bigger-than-expected rate increase may heighten volatility and have a stronger impact in the current highly leveraged environment after a decade of very low rates and ample liquidity. So when calibrating our stance, we need to pay close attention to ensuring that we do not amplify the risk of a protracted recession or trigger market dislocation.[26] Second, we must be clear about the sequencing of the normalisation process. We should avoid “cliff effects”, continually monitor the market response to our measures and consider the feedback between our different instruments. Currently, our policy rate remains a suitable marginal instrument of normalisation. It is the instrument we know best. We have a comparatively limited understanding of the effects of reducing the size of our balance sheet.[27] The size of our balance sheet will be significantly reduced as targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) mature and banks likely make early repayments after the decision we took last week to adapt the TLTROs’ terms and conditions to the current monetary policy context. We should take the necessary time to assess the impact of our rate hikes and of phasing out the TLTROs. As we normalise our monetary policy, we should expect bank lending conditions to tighten. What we need to avoid, though, is a sudden stop in the supply of credit to the broad economy. We should ensure that TLTRO repayments have been absorbed before we stop fully reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under our purchase programmes. And when considering how we would then reduce the size of our bond portfolios, a controlled reduction – whereby only redemptions above a cap are not rolled over – is preferable to active sales, which may unsettle markets in an already volatile financial environment.[28] Third, we must ensure the smooth transmission of our stance as we normalise monetary policy. Maintaining ample liquidity in the system will help ensure smooth money market functioning. This will allow us to continue tightly steering money markets through changes in our deposit facility rate. But preserving smooth transmission also means being ready to intervene in a timely manner to counter unwarranted market dysfunctions, should they arise. Our reinvestment flexibility under the pandemic emergency purchase programme – alongside the availability of the Transmission Protection Instrument, if required – protects the transmission of our monetary policy to all parts of the euro area, allowing us to set the appropriate stance. Recent months have shown that a credible ex ante commitment helps to establish a good market equilibrium, where higher yields do not drive spreads to higher levels that are disconnected from fundamentals. We also need to stand ready to address collateral issues. Collateral scarcity has recently impaired the pass-through of our policy rates to repo rates.[29] The change in TLTRO III conditions should help alleviate tensions in the repo market[30], but we will continue to monitor the situation closely. The importance of a consistent policy mix As recently seen in other economies, an inconsistent policy mix can prove destabilising. So a successful normalisation process requires other policies to be consistent with monetary policy. For instance, well-designed energy and fiscal policies can make a key contribution to dampening short-term inflationary pressures, thereby helping to keep inflation expectations anchored[31] and reducing the amount of monetary tightening necessary. To take a concrete example, the measures that have been taken to find alternatives to Russian gas, reduce gas demand and refill gas storage are likely playing an important role in bringing down gas prices. Likewise, joint initiatives at European level, common purchases and the redistribution of surplus energy sector profits can mitigate the impact of supply disruptions on energy prices. At the same time, energy policies should preserve price incentives and support energy efficiency. Fiscal policies should aim to cushion the impact on the most exposed and fragile households and firms, while not hindering the necessary trend reduction of energy demand and adding to inflationary pressures. At the same time, they should protect economic potential and ensure that the energy shock does not permanently reduce productive capacity. Just as excessively high energy demand would risk keeping inflation high for longer, so would a slump in economic potential. In response to the pandemic, Europeans acted together with consistent policies to protect productive capacity during the downturn.[32] To tackle the energy shock effectively, we can take inspiration from some of the EU pandemic-era instruments – such as SURE – to protect jobs and businesses that may be forced to temporarily reduce their activity. Common interventions at European level would preserve a level playing field, avoiding competitive distortions that would otherwise be detrimental to economic efficiency and the integrity of the Single Market. Beyond targeted support in the short term, however, fiscal policy will need to focus on investment to reduce the European economy’s exposure to supply shocks, strengthen its strategic autonomy and support potential growth. Here we could take inspiration from the Next Generation EU (NGEU) instrument and move beyond reshuffling existing funds in the financing of Repower EU, matching additional investment and reform needs with adequate resources.[33] But we should also ensure that we are implementing, in full, the agreed investments and reforms that are tied to NGEU. This will contribute to economic resilience and debt sustainability, which are crucial in view of the prevailing interest rates and growth outlook. Conclusion Let me conclude. We find ourselves in an exceptionally volatile environment, with multiple and complex risks for the inflation outlook and the appropriate monetary policy response. We are normalising our monetary policy to keep inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation back to 2% over the medium term. But we cannot ignore the sizeable challenges that we are facing. So we must calibrate our monetary policy carefully to ensure that inflation durably returns to our target, while also guiding market expectations and limiting excess volatility. Our policy stance must remain evidence-based and adapt to changes in the medium-term inflation outlook, avoiding an excessive focus on short-run developments and fully taking into account the risks emanating from the domestic and global economic and financial environment. This approach will allow us to successfully navigate the risks we face while avoiding the danger of tripping over unintended effects. Let’s therefore mind the step in adjusting our monetary policy, so we can proceed steadily through the current shocks and bring the economy back to price stability and solid growth.

For instance, recent estimates by Banco de España staff suggest that the median value of the target-consistent terminal rate across a suite of macroeconomic models lies in a range between 2.25% and 2.5%.

(2021), “Patient monetary policy amid a rocky recovery”, speech at Sciences Po, 24 November. In the euro area, the pick-up of wage growth has been more moderate and gradual than in the United States. The annual growth rate of compensation per employee is still distorted by the impact of the government measures to prevent job losses during the pandemic. Negotiated wage growth, which is less affected by these measures, stood at 2.4% (including volatile one-off payments) in the second quarter of 2022. To be consistent with the 2% inflation target under typical conditions, nominal wage growth should be equal to productivity growth plus 2%, which the September ECB staff projections expect to be the case in 2024. Inflation can play a formal or an informal role in wage setting. For more than half of the private sector employees in the euro area, inflation does not play a formal role in wage setting – but is an important factor in wage negotiations especially if inflation is high. While indexation of wages to inflation applies only to around 3% of private sector employees in the euro area, inflation plays a formal role in wage setting for one fifth of euro area private sector employees. Countries in which only minimum wages are indexed to inflation account for another fifth of private sector employees. For details, see Koester, G. and Grapow, H. (2021), “The prevalence of private sector wage indexation in the euro area and its potential role for the impact of inflation on wages”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 7, ECB. Excluding the pandemic lockdown months, this was the lowest level since April 2013. See S&P Global Flash Eurozone PMI (2022), “Eurozone economic contraction intensifies in October”, October. The weakening is especially pronounced for indicators of new business and new orders. The series starts in January 1985. See European Commission (2022), “Flash Consumer Confidence Indicator”, 21 October. Downside risks are reflected in Chart 3 by depicting the lower tail (specifically the 10th percentile) of the distribution of quarterly real GDP growth forecasted for the first and third quarters of 2023 respectively. Notably, the current estimates are well below the unconditional estimate which reflects average tail risks over a long horizon. An analysis of the underlying drivers suggests that the intensification of the downside risks to real GDP growth can be traced back predominantly to heightened financial and geopolitical risk, a bleaker macroeconomic outlook, and some deterioration in credit and financial conditions. Supply bottlenecks have started to ease in recent months and orders-to-inventory ratios have been falling rapidly. European gas prices have also fallen sharply in recent weeks. Model-based analysis by ECB staff suggests that, on average, the impact on inflation of a 100 basis point policy rate shock builds up gradually over time to reach its peak impact during the second year following the initial shock. See Lane, P. (2022), “The transmission of monetary policy”, speech at the SUERF, CGEG COLUMBIA SIPA, EIB, SOCIÉTÉ GÉNÉRALE conference on “EU and US Perspectives: New Directions for Economic Policy”, 11 October. ECB staff estimates that the downward impact on GDP growth coming from policy normalisation is on average 1 percentage point per year until 2024, while the downward impact on inflation increases gradually, reaching 1 percentage point in 2024. The estimated impact refers to the average across a set of models used by the ECB for policy simulations, including the NAWM-II model (Coenen, G., Karadi, P., Schmidt, S. and Warne, A. (2018), “The New Area-Wide Model II: an extended version of the ECB’s micro-founded model for forecasting and policy analysis with a financial sector“, Working Paper Series, No 2200, ECB, November (revised December 2019)), the ECB-BASE model (Angelini, E., Bokan, N., Kai, C., Ciccarelli, M. and Zimic, S. (2019), “Introducing ECB-BASE: The blueprint of the new ECB semi-structural model for the euro area”, Working Paper Series, No 2315, ECB, September), and the MMR model (Mazelis, F., Motto, R. and Ristiniemi, A.

(2022), “Uncoordinated monetary policies risk a historic global slowdown”, Realtime Economics Blog, Peterson Institute for International Economics, 12 September. Estimates are obtained based on a sample spanning 1991 to 2019, using high frequency-based US monetary policy shocks (sum of conventional, Odyssean forward guidance and quantitative easing) in monthly smooth local projections (see Jarociński, M. (2021), “Estimating the Fed's Unconventional Policy Shocks”, Working Paper Series, No 2585, ECB, August (revised June 2022)). Obstfeld, M. (2022), op. cit. Recent analyses show that the euro area lags notably behind the United States in terms of labour market efficiency (although levels for individual euro area countries vary, see Chart 1 in Sondermann, D. (2018), “Towards more resilient economies: The role of well-functioning economic structures”, Journal of Policy Modeling, Vol. 40, No 1, pp. 97-117). Productivity growth has also generally been lower in the euro area than in the United States for some time (see Chart 7 in Masuch, K. et al. (eds.) (2018), “Structural policies in the euro area”, Occasional Paper Series, No 210, ECB, June). These factors may limit the euro area’s relative capacity to bounce back from a recession. ESRB (2022), “Warning of the European Systemic Risk Board”, 22 September. Work stream on non-bank financial intermediation (2021), “Non-bank financial intermediation in the euro area: implications for monetary policy transmission and key vulnerabilities”, Occasional Paper Series, No 270, ECB, September (revised December 2021); Financial Stability Board (2021), “Global Monitoring Report on Non-Bank Financial Intermediation 2021”, December; European Systemic Risk Board (2022), “EU Non-bank Financial Intermediation Risk Monitor 2022”, July. These financial spillovers work partly through the exchange rate. In particular, monetary policy tightening in the United States is seen as exporting inflation through the exchange rate and driving further tightening elsewhere. It is notable that this market reaction reflects the expectation that central banks are reacting to the short-term effects of exchange rates on inflation, since the empirical evidence suggests that these short-term effects are outweighed over time by the disinflationary spillovers of the Federal Reserve’s tightening. ECB staff analysis, based on a sensitivity exercise of longer-term market-based measures of inflation compensation to larger versus smaller monetary policy shocks, suggests that, unlike in the United States, in the euro area larger monetary policy surprises do not significantly lower five-year forward five-year ahead inflation-linked swap (ILS) rates compared with smaller policy surprises. Several episodes in the recent past – such as the “taper tantrum” of 2013, the developments in the US repo market in 2019 and the recent turmoil triggered in the UK bond market by liability-driven investors – have emphasised the importance of managing risks to market functioning. As Olivier Blanchard recently observed in a tweet on 29 September, “When you have two instruments, and the effects of one are much better understood than those of the other, rely mainly on the instrument you know better. Focus on using interest rates, go slow on QT. There will be time to decrease your balance sheet.” Panetta, F. (2022), op. cit. Repurchase agreements, or repos, essentially function as a short-term secured loan in which cash is exchanged for a security (or collateral), under the agreement that the transaction is reversed at some point in the future. Repo markets are of critical importance for the smooth functioning of secondary sovereign bond markets and for providing short-term secured funding and investment opportunities for a wide range of market participants. The change in the terms and conditions of TLTRO III makes early repayments of banks’ TLTRO borrowing more likely. These repayments will alleviate banks’ balance sheet constraints and release collateral that is currently pledged with the Eurosystem, which will increase the intermediation capacity of banks in repo markets and help to mitigate the current collateral shortage. Respondents to the Consumer Expectations Survey who have become more positive in rating the adequacy of governmental measures in preserving their spending capacity have increased their inflation expectations by a smaller amount. Likewise, they have decreased their expectations of economic growth over the next 12 months by a smaller amount. Panetta, F.

This event aims to encourage a sharing of views among central bankers, treasuries, investment banks and researchers from academia. I am very pleased to see such a broad collaborative effort being made to better understand developments in markets for inflation protection. In my remarks today, I will first give a short overview of the current size of these markets in the euro area. I’m also going to summarise how the European Central Bank uses information extracted from inflation-linked products for its day-to-day analysis and assessment of monetary policy. In the final part, in view of the difficult and volatile market conditions we are currently facing, I will refer to the challenges for central banks in using information coming from markets for inflation protection. Looking back at the early times of the inflation protection market in the early 2000s, it is impressive how it has developed in terms of the size, liquidity and diversity of both issuers and investors. It has also become “mainstream” in the sense that some of the original controversies surrounding it no longer exist. Indeed, central banks no longer consider the existence of a market for inflation protection as a sign of mistrust in their ability to deliver price stability. Quite the contrary, they see it as completing the universe of financial securities and thereby expanding risk sharing in the economy and contributing to economic stability. These developments show that financial innovation can in fact provide benefits for the society, provided that it is well designed and supervised. This has not always been the case in the past, however. But it does not mean that it cannot be the case for the future. Inflation-linked bonds now constitute an important segment of the sovereign bonds issued by France, Italy and Germany (see slide 2). The outstanding amount in these three euro area countries combined has reached €350 billion so far in 2012 and the market is well established. Apart from products linked to national CPI indices, a large part of these markets consist of bonds linked to the euro area HICP, which we use at the ECB for our analyses of inflation expectations. Apart from the inflation bond market, there is a growing swap market (see slide 3). The inflation-linked swap market has gained liquidity and, for us policy-makers, it is another source of signals about inflation expectations and it helps us to understand their term structure. Finally, an interesting, but still developing market is the market for inflation options. It potentially can deliver signals on the probabilities of various inflation outcomes, as priced by investors, but the liquidity and segmentation of inflation options remain a significant challenge. Let me now say a few words on how we use signals extracted from markets for inflation protection for our daily analysis (see slide 4). The ECB monitors inflation expectations by using surveys and implied signals from swap and bond markets. Market-based indicators are more volatile than survey-based indicators. In part, the volatility is related to noise due to the market turbulence experienced in recent years. However, movements in market-based measures provide information on inflation expectations beyond what is contained in survey information. In particular, monitoring developments in inflation risk premia can help to assess inflation concerns among market participants. Looking at the developments in market-based measures of medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area during the crisis, inflation expectations seem to be well-anchored in spite of market turbulence and uncertainties regarding future developments (see slide 5). As the chart shows, the anchoring is confirmed by stable survey-based measures as well. Comparing euro area data with that of the United States and United Kingdom, inflation expectations in the euro area derived from inflation-linked markets seem to have been relatively stable during the financial crisis, in fact more stable than for the other two currency areas (see slide 6). For the euro area in particular, inflation expectations have remained very well anchored following the non-standard liquidity provision measures undertaken by the ECB. The anchoring of expectations at relatively low levels probably reflects continued negative output gaps in the euro area as well as confidence that the ECB will be able and willing to drain liquidity if and when necessary to control inflation. In a nutshell, it is evidence that the euro area financial crisis has not eroded trust in the euro as a currency. However, central banks are currently facing important challenges in using information from markets for inflation protection to support monetary policy decisions (see slide 7). During the crisis, and especially after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, inflation-linked markets were characterised by high volatility and low market liquidity, which made it very difficult for policy-makers to infer signals about the level of inflation expectations, as perceived by market participants. Also, they have not escaped the trend towards fragmentation which has been a common feature of euro area capital markets throughout this crisis. During the euro area sovereign bond market crisis, and especially in the second half of 2011, country-specific developments were increasingly apparent. In particular, the rising yield spread between French and German bonds meant that the euro area real yield curve estimated on French and German bonds became biased. The technical solution was to split the estimation of the real yield curve into the country-specific yield curves before aggregating back to a euro area real yield curve. I believe our colleagues will present this new approach in more detail during the workshop. Finally, regarding the markets for inflation options, we still need to understand better to what extent we can trust the signals extracted from these markets as being accurate information on the inflation and deflation tail risks perceived by investors. We need to understand the impact of particularly large players in the options market on shorter-term price developments and need to find ways to assess the maturity of these markets. Our goal should be to be able to routinely extract probability density functions for inflation expectations based on a robust methodology, as we already do for short-term interest rates or stock indices. This would be particularly useful to inform our policy making process in a world where risk management plays a key role in policy decisions. Having briefly sketched out our analysis and concerns, I would like to stress that the ECB has a strong interest in the developments in markets for inflation protection. They provide us with tools for monitoring inflation expectations in the euro area for various horizons at a high frequency. Such tools are unique and that is why we need to make sure that we interpret the information from inflation markets correctly and understand the broader context of the observed developments. I trust this workshop will give you a good opportunity to reflect on these issues. I would like to wish you some interesting and productive discussions.

Following years of too-low inflation and policy oriented at addressing deflationary risks, we are now in an environment of two-way inflation risks and heightened short-term volatility (Chart 1). Markets are indicating increasing uncertainty about the inflation outlook, and investors’ expectations of lift-off dates have become more dispersed. In this environment, central banks must clarify their reaction function, so that market expectations remain aligned with their policy intentions. This, in turn, requires a clear framework for thinking about inflation developments and what conditions would warrant a monetary policy response. We are facing a unique combination of shocks that reflect the exceptional nature of the recovery from the pandemic: supply bottlenecks, surging energy prices and labour market frictions. We cannot say exactly when these factors will normalise. But in order to design our policy action, we need to gauge their implications for inflation in the medium term. Our focus needs to be on the risk that inflation in the medium term turns out persistently lower or higher than our 2% target, rather than on short-run developments. Today, I will argue that globally we are seeing a mix of demand and supply shocks, but in the euro area supply constraints dominate to a much greater degree than in some other major economies. This is leading to a temporary spike in the price level, which acts as a “tax” on consumption and a brake on production, over time generating effects akin to an adverse demand shock. In this context, so long as higher short-run inflation does not feed into inflation expectations and wage and price-setting in a destabilising way, monetary policy should remain patient.[1] We should not exacerbate the risk of supply shocks morphing into a demand shock and threatening the recovery by prematurely tightening monetary policy – or by passively tolerating an undesirable tightening in financing conditions. We should remain focused on completing the recovery, returning GDP to its pre-crisis trend, as the condition for achieving self-sustained inflation at our target in the medium term. To this end, we should keep using all of our instruments for as long as warranted, with the necessary flexibility to support the transmission of our policy stance throughout the euro area on its uncertain path out of the pandemic. Chart 1 Euro area core inflation (month-on-month percentage changes, annualised, seasonally and working-day adjusted) Source: ECB Three types of inflation: the good, the bad and the ugly For illustrative purposes, we can identify three different types of inflation. The first is “good” inflation, which comes about when demand is robust, output is at potential, employment is high, inflation is converging towards 2% and inflation expectations are anchored at 2%.[2] Such inflation is consistent with wages rising at a pace that reflects our target and productivity gains, thereby supporting real disposable income. It does not distort economic decisions and creates a buffer in nominal interest rates that allows monetary policy to address subsequent negative shocks. After a deep recession like the one caused by the pandemic, monetary policy should accompany the economy towards a strong recovery as a necessary condition for “good” inflation. In the euro area, with monetary policy holding down nominal yields, real yields have eased, leading to a fast recovery and strong employment gains.[3] The second type, “bad” inflation, occurs when negative supply shocks raise prices and depress economic activity. This outcome is typically seen, for example, following a sharp supply shock that raises energy prices, which for the euro area is equivalent to a terms of trade “tax” and compresses real disposable income. Such inflation typically falls once the supply shock is reabsorbed. A central bank would usually aim to be patient and look through “bad” inflation. A premature tightening of monetary policy could turn the supply shock into a prolonged recession, thereby depressing demand and undermining price stability in the medium term. This is a key reason for the flexible medium-term horizon of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.[4] The third type of inflation is “ugly” inflation, which arises when above-target inflation – regardless of its drivers – de-anchors inflation expectations and becomes persistent through wage and price-setting behaviour. In this situation inflation can spiral upwards. A central bank committed to price stability must therefore act decisively to break the circuit if it observes clear signals that this is about to materialise. The nature of current euro area inflation So, which type of inflation are we seeing today? The data suggest the current picture is dominated by a bout of “bad” inflation generated outside the euro area, whereas we are far from seeing abnormally large domestic demand. The euro area is facing an inflation spike which results from a mixture of purely temporary factors, such as base effects (Chart 2, left-hand side),[5] and from global supply shocks that are hitting the economy at a time when demand worldwide is normalising. The dominant driver at present is the surge in energy prices globally.[6] In October, energy contributed 2.2 percentage points to inflation, the largest contribution in the history of the euro area (Chart 2, right-hand side).[7] This is pushing up short-run inflation, which has still not reached its peak. Two observations are worth emphasising. First, 80% of headline inflation reflects shocks generated abroad, mainly because the euro area is a net importer of energy and commodities (Chart 3, left-hand side). In fact, headline inflation exceeds domestically-generated inflation[8] to an extent never seen before (Chart 3, right-hand side). Higher import prices are compressing household real disposable income and increasing firms’ production costs.[9] Second, although strong global demand is exacerbating pandemic-related bottlenecks worldwide, in the euro area, this is mostly translating into a negative supply shock, which is pushing up core inflation. This shock is especially visible in longer supplier delivery times, which are in turn reducing the availability and increasing the price of durables (Chart 4, left-hand side).[10] Quantitatively, survey indicators suggest that in the euro area most (about two-thirds) of the rise in suppliers’ delivery times is due to supply factors. The supply shock is hitting our economy at an earlier stage of its recovery; in fact, the euro area is lagging behind the global recovery in demand. Services consumption remains well below its pre-crisis level;[11] and durable goods consumption is showing nothing like the boom that is ongoing in the United States (Chart 5). This may explain why, despite the global nature of supply bottlenecks, core inflation on a two-year basis – i.e. stripping out base effects – is much lower than in the United States (Chart 4, right-hand side). So, applying the reaction function to “bad” inflation that I laid out earlier, monetary policy should remain patient. A premature tightening would restrain spending before demand has returned to trend. We could end up with a demand shortfall when supply normalises and inventories build up,[12] resulting in too-low medium-term inflation and employment. We should therefore not react by curbing the recovery in our domestic demand – or put it at risk by tolerating unwarranted spillovers to financing conditions from abroad.[13] Chart 2 Left-hand panel.

Assessing the medium-term balance of risks That said, we should not ignore the risks to medium-term inflation, as the forces driving up inflation today could turn out to be more persistent than expected. If this were to happen, it would exacerbate risks in both directions. On the one hand, “bad” inflation could eventually turn into “ugly” inflation if persistent upward price pressures were to de-anchor inflation expectations and destabilise wage and price-setting. This would be an argument for a tightening of monetary conditions. On the other hand, “bad inflation”, acting as a “tax” on demand, could ultimately move the economy further away from full capacity utilisation, depressing medium-term underlying inflation. This might require an easing of monetary policy. Provided the risks are not excessive on both sides, a steady hand – preserving the prevailing stance of monetary policy – should be the preferred course of action. So how can we evaluate the medium-term balance of risks from today’s standpoint? Risks of persistent inflation dynamics To begin with, we need to assess whether we are likely to see propagation mechanisms that could transform the current price level shock into destabilising inflation dynamics, in particular a wage-price spiral. Typically, a sustained increase in wages requires the economy to be operating persistently above potential. This is not currently the case in the euro area. Estimates of the output gap suggest that it will take time before it is convincingly positive (Chart 6, left-hand side). And although the labour market is recovering, there is still slack: we have half a million fewer jobs than before the pandemic, approximately 2.4 million workers are still under job retention schemes[14] and hours worked are down by around 4% from their pre-pandemic levels[15] (Chart 6, right-hand side). Moreover, in the second quarter of this year, there were 1.4 million fewer workers in the labour force than in the last quarter of 2019. Some of those who were discouraged from working or looking for work during the pandemic may seek to rejoin the labour force as the recovery takes hold.[16] Wage pressures could still emerge before the economy reaches full capacity if there are widespread matching inefficiencies in the labour market – for instance owing to structural changes triggered by the pandemic – or if the inflation spike impacts wage bargaining dynamics. But neither appears to be the case today. First, we see no real evidence of a broad-based skill mismatch across the economy. We are seeing high job vacancy rates, especially in the high-contact services that have recently reopened, but we are also seeing strong growth in employment. This suggests that the economy is largely following the normal movement along the Beveridge curve[17] seen during recoveries, undergoing a typical matching process (Chart 7, left-hand side).[18] Second, negotiated wage increases are subdued despite the inflation spike, suggesting that in their bargaining with employers unions may be prioritising non-wage factors, such as job security (Chart 7, right-hand side). This may reflect prudence following recent crises and amid renewed uncertainty, or structural factors related to labour-saving investments in digitalisation and automation.[19] Modest wage demands also suggest that inflation expectations remain well anchored. That picture is corroborated by market-based and survey-based measures – at both medium- and longer-term horizons – which show no signs of de-anchoring. What we see is rather inflation expectations re-anchoring towards our 2% target from below, especially when filtering out risk premia (Chart 8). An increase in risk premia in inflation compensation is common in response to a supply shock.[20] The fact that we do not see wage-price spirals is not too surprising. Workers, employers and financial investors know that the ECB would decisively counter any destabilising increase in medium-term inflation. And this commitment matters: when central banks are credible, commodity and energy prices are poor predictors of future core inflation.[21] Wage growth is expected to pick up as the recovery matures, but we should not be alarmed if we see signs of a one-off catch-up in wages next year.[22] Over the medium term it is desirable that we see increases in unit labour costs[23] that are consistent with our inflation target, since this is critical for 2% inflation to become self-sustained. But for now unit labour cost dynamics remain subdued. And as productivity is expected to increase after the pandemic, the effects of increasing wages on unit labour cost growth will tend to be tempered.[24]. Higher wages would instead help sustain consumer demand. Chart 6 Left-hand panel. Sources: Eurostat, Deutsche Bundesbank, September NIPE and ECB staff calculations.

Risks to economic activity The downside risks to economic activity may be growing. We should monitor the risk that a long-lasting negative supply shock prevents the economy from reaching full capacity. Globally, supply bottlenecks now appear to be slowing the recovery (Chart 9, left-hand side).[25] That drag is affecting forward-looking indicators of activity in the euro area, which are plateauing and in some cases already pointing downwards (Chart 9, right-hand side). It may soon become visible in actual GDP growth. Supply-side disruptions and the uncertainty regarding the economic outlook also look to be weighing on the already unsatisfactory recovery in investment in major economies (Chart 10, left-hand side). In parallel, the rise in energy prices will likely pull back demand in the euro area: a 10% rise in oil prices typically reduces consumption by 0.28% over three years,[26] and oil prices have risen by around 60% in 2021.[27] Since energy demand has a low price elasticity,[28] this could spill over into lower spending on non-essential services.[29] In addition, rising energy prices may have important effects on firms’ employment decisions.[30] Governments have adopted compensatory measures in the euro area – although with significant differences across countries – but they are likely to only partly offset the negative impact on real disposable income. And the lower income households, which spend most[31] on utilities, perceive those support measures to be the least adequate (Chart 10, right-hand side). The main offsetting factor will therefore need to come from continued improvements in the labour market and the underlying strength of the economy. Finally, we should not forget that, regrettably, another major wave of infections is under way in the euro area, triggering renewed restrictions, some already introduced, with others potentially on the way. This could weigh on economic activity and, in particular, consumer confidence, further holding back wage demands. So, if the sources of higher inflation today do last longer, there is little or no evidence at this stage to suggest that they would feed into wage-price spirals or a de-anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area. There are, instead, signs that they could weaken the recovery and reduce underlying inflation pressures. And we should not forget that in the last decade insufficient domestic demand growth in the euro area resulted in inflation that was persistently below our aim and in the accumulation of a price level gap that remains significant (Chart 11). All in all, on the basis of the available information, there seems to be little chance of sustained inflation above 2% in the medium term. Chart 9 Left-hand panel.

Most importantly, we still need to complete the recovery. A major achievement of the European crisis response was to provide a common answer to a common shock. Now, we need common policies to support a common recovery, underpinning the sustained return of inflation to our target. Next Generation EU provides the fiscal support for the recovery, but continued monetary stimulus is necessary to cement progress. If we lose patience now, we will put at risk everything we have achieved so far. Until we see tangible evidence that upside risks to medium-term inflation are materialising, we should continue to look through the current inflation spike. We should not be afraid of wage growth that is consistent with our inflation target. And we should not ignore risks on the downside, especially as we face an asymmetry of tools in reacting to negative shocks given the proximity of our policy rates to their effective lower bound. Indeed, one of the main innovations of our strategy review is that, owing to this asymmetry, we need to be forceful and persistent in our monetary action to bring medium-term inflation sustainably to our target – even if it requires a moderate transitory overshoot.[32] This persistence is reflected in our forward guidance on interest rates, which clarifies that until we see inflation lastingly reach 2% over the second half of the projection horizon, we will not start raising rates. Our forward guidance also includes sufficient realised progress in underlying inflation as a condition, precisely to ensure that on-target inflation will be durable and to look through supply shocks. That condition is not close to being met. In the vicinity of the lower bound the stance of monetary policy is also defined by the volume and distribution of asset purchases, which help control benchmark rates at the longer end of the yield curve. Three observations matter here. First, the surge in the number of infections and the renewed introduction of pandemic-related restrictions in some euro area countries mean that the pandemic is not over yet. Second, an inappropriate, sharp reduction of purchases would be tantamount to a tightening of the policy stance. Net asset purchases will continue to be an essential ingredient of our monetary policy stance even if the pandemic emergency purchase programme comes to an end. They need to be calibrated to help ensure we reach our target, avoiding an undesirable, premature increase in long-term interest rates. Third, so that we can continue to transmit our policy impulses across the entire euro area, the flexibility that has served us well in past months should become an integral element of our asset purchases.[33] This will enable us to act – if necessary – in an environment where the exit from the pandemic may have asymmetric effects. We should not tolerate any financial fragmentation which could impede the transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area. We have learned from the past decade that this is crucial for price stability in a monetary union. Conclusion Let me conclude. In Europe, we are no longer facing one-way inflation risks to the downside. This is to the credit of the successful macroeconomic response, of which monetary policy was a key component. But now is not the time to be declaring victory. We should not be distracted by short-term volatility or transient factors related to the atypical economic situation we are seeing. Rather, based on empirical evidence, we must continually assess the underlying strength of the economy and the two-way risks created by supply shocks. For now, our policy stance needs to remain focused – through all of our instruments – on the objective of ensuring a lasting return of inflation to our medium-term target of 2%. Only a determined and predictable policy that accompanies demand back to its pre-crisis trend will guarantee price stability in the medium term, in line with our mandate. For monetary policy today, patience is the most courageous form of action. See Lagarde, C. (2021), “Commitment and persistence: monetary policy in the economic recovery”, Keynote speech at the 31st Frankfurt European Banking Congress 2021 “From Recovery to Strength”, 19 November. Evidence accumulated since 2003 suggests that nominal rigidities remain a prevalent feature of the euro area, with some differences as regards prices and wages. Price-setting may have become more flexible and there is no evidence for any especially strong downward rigidities in price-setting. At the same time, persistent downward nominal wage rigidity (DWR) provides a strong argument for a positive inflation buffer to “grease the wheels” of the euro area economy – also in order to avoid the risk of macroeconomic adjustments being managed in terms of quantities (unemployment) rather than prices when DWR is binding and particularly when productivity growth is low. See Consolo, A., Koester, G., Nickel, C., Porqueddu, M. and Smets, F. (2021), “The need for an inflation buffer in the ECB’s price stability objective – the role of nominal rigidities and inflation differentials”, Occasional Paper Series, No 279, ECB, September. Panetta, F. (2021), “Mind the gap(s): monetary policy and the way out of the pandemic”, Speech at an online event organised by Bocconi University, 2 March. In its recent review of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, the Governing Council confirmed the medium-term orientation of its strategy and acknowledged that the appropriate monetary policy response to a deviation of inflation from the target depends on the origin, magnitude and persistence of the deviation. Base effects are statistical effects with a temporary impact on inflation. For example, to stimulate demand during the pandemic, German VAT rates were temporarily reduced in July 2020. The subsequent normalisation of (increase in) VAT rates in January 2021 led to a temporary increase in annual HICP inflation in the second half of the year equal to approximately 1.2 percentage points for Germany and 0.35 percentage points for the euro area as a whole. This base effect will be reabsorbed from January 2022. According to ECB staff estimates, energy is the main reason for the higher-than-projected headline inflation seen in recent months. The previous high was 1.67 percentage points in July 2008. More domestically-generated inflation refers to the items in the HICP that are characterised by a direct and indirect import content in consumption expenditure of less than 15%. See Fröhling, A., O'Brien, D. and Schaefer, S. (2021), “A new measure for domestic inflation in the euro area”, mimeo. See Bokan, N., Dossche, M. and Rossi, L. (2018), “Oil prices, the terms of trade and private consumption”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 6, ECB. The mechanism described in the text applies mainly to non-energy industrial goods but also to services. In addition, base effects related to the negative inflation in some sectors during the pandemic are also affecting services price inflation. See also Moëc, G. (2021), “Second-guessing the second-round effects”, AXA IM Research and Strategy Insights, No 108, 11 October.

Workers in job retention schemes who do not work for more than three months are not considered employed. As many workers in job retention schemes do actually work, the figures on employment include some of the workers covered by job retention schemes. Based on data for the second quarter of 2021. In particular, the pandemic has led to a decline in the participation rate of older workers, who contributed most to the upward trend in labour participation in the euro area before the pandemic. See Bodnár, K. and O’Brien, D. (2021), “Labour supply developments in the euro area during the COVID-19 pandemic”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 7, ECB. The Beveridge curve captures the negative relationship between the unemployment rate and the job vacancy rate. The underlying intuition is that, as vacancies (vacant job positions) increase, the number of people unemployed decreases. The shape and the position of the curve also provide important information about the functioning of the labour market. See Consolo, A. and Dias da Silva, A. (2019), “The euro area labour market through the lens of the Beveridge curve”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 4, ECB. See Blanchard, O.J. and Diamond, P., “The Beveridge Curve”, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 1989, No 1, 1989, Washington DC, pp. 1-76. In addition, the likelihood of wage-setting schemes triggering second-round effects based on inflation indexation looks to be limited, particularly when it comes to energy inflation. See Koester, G. and Grapow, H. (2021), “The prevalence of private sector wage indexation in the euro area and its potential role for the impact of inflation on wages”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 7, ECB. See Chen, A., Engstrom, E. and Grishchenko, O. (2016), “Has the inflation risk premium fallen? Is it now negative?”, FEDS Notes, , April. Evans, C. and Fisher, J. (2011), “What are the implications of rising commodity prices for inflation and monetary policy?”, Chicago Fed Letter, No 286, May. A one-off catch-up in wages is a phenomenon that is likely to arise. Ultimately the terms of trade “tax” determined by higher energy prices – to the extent that it is not sterilised by public interventions – will have to be absorbed by the factors of production (labour and capital, through wages and profits) in proportions that depend on the respective bargaining power in the labour market. Unit labour costs are compensation per employee adjusted for productivity. After the pandemic, productivity might increase owing to conjunctural factors (productivity is typically procyclical) or structural adjustments, for instance as a result of higher levels of digitalisation. ECB estimates find that the supply shocks that have emerged since October 2020 have slowed down world exports by almost 3 percentage points since October 2020 and industrial production by more than 1 percentage point. See Frohm, E., Gunnella, V., Mancini, M. and Schuler, T. (2021), “The impact of supply bottlenecks on trade”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 6, ECB. Given the euro area’s deep integration into global value chains, these supply shocks weigh on euro area activity more than that of the rest of the world.

Evidence from the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey shows that households which perceive government support measures aimed at easing the burden of higher energy prices to be less adequate have also revised down their expected spending on holidays over the next year. Recent evidence finds that rising electricity prices negatively impact employment, with the impact unevenly distributed across sectors and countries and more pronounced for financially constrained firms.

Our strategy review recognises that we are well- equipped to deal with risks on the upside, but in a situation where growth weakens and inflation undershoots our target over the medium term, the effective lower bound would limit our policy space.

I feel grateful and humbled to have been given a chance to be part of this effort. I would like to thank former President Mario Draghi, my Executive Board and Governing Council colleagues, and the staff of this great institution for their friendship and trust. And I would like to wish Isabel Schnabel and Fabio Panetta the best of luck. The starting point for my remarks this morning is people’s sense of frustration and their criticism of central banks for failing to deliver inflation consistent with their aim. This criticism has taken different forms in society. Professional observers and financial market participants often criticise the inadequate size of our actions and question the effectiveness of our instruments. Private citizens criticise the type of instruments we use – in particular asset purchases and negative interest rates – and the side effects they associate with them. The use of these instruments has caused persistent mistrust. While three in four euro area citizens think the single currency is good for the European Union and two in three think it is good for their country, less than half of citizens trust the ECB.[2] In my remarks this morning, I would like to make two points that speak to these concerns. The first is that there is no contradiction between inflation being low and monetary policy being effective. Central banks have achieved great success in recent years. Their achievements, however, and this will be my second point, are of little avail if the public does not recognise or understand them. I will argue that this “veil of effectiveness” creates enormous challenges for the credibility and acceptance of central banks – challenges which can only be overcome by revisiting the appropriateness of four key components at the heart of our current monetary policy frameworks: how we define price stability, how we measure inflation, how we evaluate the credibility of our intentions and the range of counterparts through which we implement monetary policy. Low inflation and the effectiveness of monetary policy My first point – how to square low inflation with policy effectiveness – centres on two separate questions. How should we, the central banking community, evaluate the effectiveness of our own actions? And why, despite years of extraordinary policy support, is inflation remaining stubbornly low? Evaluating our own actions is surprisingly difficult. There is no handbook, no checklist that we can use to consistently grade our actions. Ultimately, of course, there can only be one yardstick to measure central bank effectiveness: our track record in delivering inflation consistent with our aim. But does inflation failing to converge to our aim mechanically imply that our actions have not been effective? My answer is a clear “no”. Despite unprecedented challenges to monetary policy implementation, central banks have succeeded in delivering financial and monetary conditions that are exceptionally supportive of real economic activity. Many euro area firms can currently borrow in financial markets at negative rates. Bank lending rates, also for small and medium-sized firms, are currently at, or close to, historical lows, with little dispersion across major economies. Firms have responded to these incentives as economic theory would predict. Over the past five years, real investment has expanded at a faster pace than in the five years preceding the global financial crisis. This is no small achievement considering the persistent uncertainty that has weighed on sentiment in recent years. Investment, in turn, has boosted job creation. Employment is up by 7% compared with mid-2014. And in many euro area countries wages are growing at the fastest pace in many years. All in all, ECB staff estimates show that, without our policy actions, euro area real GDP would have been up to 2.7 percentage points lower at the end of last year, and inflation would have been up to half a percentage point lower every year over the past four years.[3] Explaining low inflation Such counterfactuals – based on a wide range of models – are important proof that policy has been effective along the full chain of transmission – from financial market prices to economic activity and from the real side to the nominal side. For everything we know about how policy propagates through the economy, inflation today would be significantly weaker in the absence of our actions, maybe even dangerously close to deflation. But such counterfactuals are far too complex to lend true credibility to our actions outside of our narrow circle. They still raise the question as to why policy support has failed to promote a more robust convergence of inflation to levels that would allow a normalisation of policy – that would allow graduating the instruments that have caused mistrust and concern. There are two broad hypotheses for why this might be the case. The first is that policy has been wrongly calibrated – that is, slack is larger than widely assumed, and policy should be even more accommodative. True, the output gap is an elusive concept that should never have become a gauge for conducting public policy, and it may be larger than thought.[4] And broader measures of unemployment that include, for example, involuntary part-time work remain well above headline unemployment. But these measures are now no longer higher than they were before the crisis. I would also dismiss the assertion that the relationship between output and inflation has broken down. A plethora of empirical studies prove that the Phillips curve is alive and well.[5] The second, and in my view more plausible, explanation is that the Phillips curve has shifted inward over time – that is, inflation today may be lower at every level of the output gap. Such shifts typically relate to persistent and slow-moving changes on the supply side of our economies, where monetary policy has less traction. As such, they are difficult to detect, and even more difficult to prove, in particular when they coincide with weak aggregate demand. But collectively their impact on wage and price inflation is difficult to dismiss.[6] Just consider the structural changes in global energy markets where the shale oil revolution has effectively put a ceiling on oil prices by increasing the responsiveness of oil supply to demand shocks.[7] Think of the secular decline in wage bargaining power that contributed to a significant part of recent productivity gains no longer being distributed to labour, with adverse consequences for real disposable incomes, consumption growth and, ultimately, inflation.[8] Or consider the salient impact of digitalisation on the pricing power of brick and mortar firms, which may have contributed, at least in part, to the recent decline in the pass-through of higher wage costs to consumer prices.[9] Add to these shocks the effects of ageing, the rise of services and the broader effects of globalisation and it is hard not to conclude that the combination of these shocks is likely to have put a lid on inflation in recent years, and that these shocks are likely to constrain price pressure also in the near future.[10] None of this is necessarily bad news. Many of these shocks are in fact benign, in the sense that they have the potential to ultimately lift productivity and real wages and pave the way to a low-carbon economy. Central banks clearly need to step up their research and modelling capacities to understand their joint impact.[11] But until this happens – and the pace will depend a lot on our broader economic policy framework, which I won’t discuss this morning[12] – central banks are likely to have to navigate in a low-growth, low-inflation environment with the risk of repeatedly failing to deliver inflation in line with their aim. Monetary policy in a low-inflation environment What, then, can, or should, central banks do in this environment? Let me propose four elements for future reflection: how we define price stability, how we treat inflation expectations, how we measure inflation and how we implement monetary policy. Some proposals are more far-reaching than others. But all share one aim: to bring monetary policy closer to the people – to dismantle the veil of effectiveness and to foster acceptance of policies and instruments that too often are used as scapegoat for shortcomings and deficiencies elsewhere in our public policy apparatus. Rethinking the definition of price stability Consider first the ECB’s definition of price stability as inflation rates of “below, but close to, 2%”. A simple answer to the current challenges would be to lower the inflation aim. If my dissection of the current inflation drivers is vaguely on the right track, then it is clear that this strategy would be wrong on many levels. It would misjudge the current low-inflation episode as permanent and thereby dismiss the lessons of history on the slow pace of diffusion of new technologies.[13] It would create perilous time-consistency challenges for central banks when inflation eventually transitions to the new steady state. And it would shift a disproportionate share of the macroeconomic adjustment burden onto workers as, even more so than today, shocks to euro area economies would have to be accommodated by lowering nominal wages. Not the best way to foster support for Europe and its single currency! Raising the aim is similarly misguided. Why raise an aim that you have failed to achieve in the first place? I come at this debate from a different angle. If we communicate that we aim to maintain inflation at, say, 1.9%, then we should not be surprised if the public expects us to control inflation up to the first decimal point. It significantly raises the bar for maintaining the credibility of monetary policy, particularly given how little the public actually knows about inflation and monetary policy.[14] We need to dismantle the absurd idea of an omnipotent central bank that can mechanically steer inflation. The ECB should clarify that it aims to deliver inflation of 2% over the medium term. And it could communicate the range of inflation outcomes that can be considered acceptable in normal times. Such a tolerance band, which can be more or less precise, is not an invitation for inaction or complacency. Research shows that central banks have a strong incentive to already respond to inflation deviations within the tolerance zone, rather than waiting until inflation has crossed the edges.[15] And there is no convincing evidence that a tolerance band weakens the anchoring role of a midpoint.[16] It rather recognises the large and inherent uncertainty surrounding price and wage decisions, conveys this uncertainty to the general public and its elected representatives and establishes consistency with the medium-term horizon of the ECB’s strategy. For this change to be effective, however, two elements are critical. First, the ECB would need to do more to communicate the midpoint to the broader public. A recent survey in the United States showed that only a quarter of respondent households knew of the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation aim.[17] And, second, the ECB would need to establish a clear track record that emphasises the centrality of the midpoint in the conduct of its policy. The 2% needs to remain the clear nominal anchor for coordinating both expectations and actions. Which inflation expectations matter? The second element we should review relates to how we should evaluate expected deviations from the midpoint target.[18] Critics would dismiss the idea of tolerance bands around the inflation aim because they fear that, by signalling our comfort with a range of inflation rates below 2%, we would entrench expectations of low inflation and risk downplaying the nominal anchor. I have two comments in response to these fears. The first is that we can no longer ignore the fact that medium-term inflation expectations of both professional forecasters and financial market participants have persistently adjusted lower. Adaptive expectations are rational at times of deep structural change.[19] My second comment is really more of a question: which expectations should central banks consider when evaluating risks to the inflation outlook? Neither the academic community nor the central banking community have ever provided an answer to this question. I see a large gap between the role played by inflation expectations in our profession and the extent of central banks’ actual knowledge about how expectations ultimately affect inflation outcomes and which expectations are concerned. Market-based measures are convenient because they are readily available. But convenience may prove delusive. Household inflation expectations, for example, have been found to be a better proxy of firms’ pricing decisions than those of professional forecasters or financial market participants.[20] But expectations by household have pointed in a very different direction in recent times, painting a much less dire picture regarding the inflation outlook. According to one survey, households believed that annual euro area inflation between 2004 and 2018 was close to 9%, when in fact it was 1.6%.[21] Does the consumer price index need to be changed? The third element relates to the way we measure inflation. The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) has been a tremendous achievement in terms of providing a reliable, timely and comparable measure of consumer inflation across EU Member States. But whether it adequately captures the cost of living should be subject to regular review. A well-known example is the cost of housing. The HICP captures only marginally the largest single lifetime expenditure of households – their cost of housing. Housing costs currently enter the HICP mainly through actual rentals, with a weight of just 6.5%. The costs of owner-occupied housing, by contrast, are not included even though more than 65% of households in the euro area own their main residence.[22] Careful reflection is warranted but allowing a wedge to persist between the inflation that households perceive and the rate we officially measure can undermine the validity of our actions. Rethinking central banks’ toolkit Re-evaluating the appropriateness of these three elements – the inflation aim, the role of inflation expectations and inflation measurement – would probably go a long way towards revitalising policy in line with the current challenges. But it may not be enough. If the current environment of persistently low underlying inflation and elevated uncertainty were to persist well into the future – and there is a risk that it may – then the odds are large that firms and social partners will increasingly start adjusting prices and wages accordingly. In this case, more forceful policy action would be needed. One option would then be to do more of the same. I have no doubt that the ECB can further ease financing conditions by deploying its current instruments. But one may doubt whether this approach would be more effective in bringing inflation closer to the aim than it has been so far. And one may wonder how far the depth of our shallow capital markets can be sounded, and whether the side effects of our measures would not outweigh the benefits at some point in the future. A second possible, and complementary, option is to coordinate economic policies more closely. The combination of limited fiscal policy space in many euro area countries, political fixation on large fiscal surpluses in some, and the persistent opposition to a common fiscal capacity makes this option less credible, however. Coordination with fiscal authorities cannot be a fig leaf for central bank inaction or inability to act. And it can easily degenerate into a threat to central bank independence. But central banks have one key strength, and that is their agility. They have always been able to reinvent themselves, to innovate and overcome even severe impediments to transmission. And if transmission through financial markets and banks hits a wall – if the third stage of transmission remains anaemic – then central banks have the obvious choice of considering whether to broaden the set of counterparties through which they implement monetary policy. The discussion about central bank digital currencies is a case in point. At the heart of this discussion is the question of whether central banks should grant the general public direct access to their balance sheets. This question comes with many thorny technological choices and policy challenges, in particular with regard to financial stability and the future of credit intermediation, as we know.[23] But assuming that these challenges can be overcome, then there are few reasons why central banks, within their mandate, should not apply the same set of instruments to accounts of private individuals that they currently apply to banks – that is, charge interest rates on central bank digital money.[24] By going to the heart of consumer choices, this approach would likely be more effective and faster in stimulating demand and inflation, and it could have less negative side effects. Rather than addressing the symptoms of low inflation, this would amount to precision surgery on the Euler equation. None of this is to say that it would be trivial. Ultimately, central banks would need to weigh the costs against the benefits – just like we did for other unconventional policy measures. What we should avoid, however, is restricting our toolkit for dogmatic reasons or intellectual convenience, and giving up on our ability to deliver on our mandate. If monetary policy remains a conversation between central banks and financial markets, we shouldn’t be surprised if people don’t trust us. Too many see us as part of a financial system which has failed to deliver growth and fairness. And this also curtails our policy options. Conclusion Let me conclude. Technological progress will continue to transform monetary policy in the future. To what extent and in what ways will depend both on the preferences of society and the risks that a very protracted period of low inflation poses to macroeconomic and financial stability. There will be evolutionary changes that will ensure that current and tested policy frameworks remain fit for purpose. These changes may include progress on how we measure inflation and the evolving consensus on how we define price stability. And there will be revolutionary changes, similar in scale and scope to the shift from banknotes to bank deposits a few centuries ago or the recent adoption of negative interest rates. Technology will create new policy choices and options enabling central banks to continue acting within their mandates. As Mario Draghi said at his last press conference: “Never give up!” I wish Christine Lagarde and her team the best of luck and I fully trust that they will find the wisdom and courage to act in the face of ever changing conditions, as the ECB has always done in its history.

[6]Some of these shocks are likely to have shifted the wage Phillips curve rather the price Phillips curve. While theory is unclear about the strength of the pass-through from wage growth to price inflation in the short run, long run labour cost inflation and price inflation are closely interrelated. For the euro area, recent empirical evidence confirms a clear, stable and shock-dependent link between labour cost and price inflation (see Bobeica et al.

(2017), “Macroeconomic Benefits of the Shale Oil Revolution”, Moody’s Analytics. In addition, the transition to a low-carbon economy has initiated a process through which demand for fossil fuels will gradually decline. Along this trajectory, the marginal cost of harvesting renewable energy is likely to become considerably lower and more stable than in the current regime. See, for example, Bielen et al.

[8]In France, for example, the share of workers that are trade union members fell from 23% in 1975 to 9% today. In Germany, it fell from 35% to 17% over the same period. Partly as a result of this, over the past 25 years real aggregate productivity per hour in the euro area has increased by more than three times as much as real compensation per hour.

Cavallo finds that price levels on websites and physical stores are identical 72% of the time. Price changes are not synchronised but are similar in frequency and average size. More research is needed to understand the underlying factors. But what might be happening is that increased price transparency through the internet limits the ability of firms to increase prices in physical stores. [10]See, for example, Cœuré, B.

Conferences of this kind are very helpful to us as central bankers, as they enable us to advance our thinking about policy-relevant questions, particularly if they are related to our core mandate. In concluding this conference, let me say a few words about economic slack in the euro area and the wage-inflation pass-through. I think these are interesting topics at the moment, because, as you know, euro area inflation has been persistently low for several years, and more recently we have observed some decoupling of wage inflation from price inflation. Current situation Euro area consumer price inflation currently stands at 1% (August 2019, year-on-year HICP inflation) and is thus considerably below our inflation aim. Unfortunately, this low inflation has been a persistent phenomenon. Since November 2011, when euro area inflation peaked at 3% (year-on-year HICP inflation), the average rate has been less than 1.2% per annum. Long-term inflation expectations are also low. Market-based indicators are stagnating at historically low levels. The five-year five-year inflation-linked swap rate has been hovering around 1.25% in recent weeks. Survey-based measures have also fallen recently, to 1.7%. While these numbers are higher than those for market-based indicators, we shouldn’t take comfort from them. International evidence shows that survey expectations can react very slowly to persistently low inflation (as was the case in Japan, for example). Wage inflation, on the other hand, has behaved quite differently to consumer price inflation. Since 2017, wage inflation, as measured by compensation per employee, has overtaken consumer price inflation, peaking at 2.4% in the third quarter of 2018. These developments raise important questions. Is the euro area economy hitting its capacity constraints? Or is there still economic slack that is holding headline inflation down? How will wage inflation pass through to price inflation? How to measure economic slack There are signs of a tight labour market. In addition to the wage dynamics I just mentioned, we have observed the unemployment rate moving close to its pre-crisis low, with participation rates being higher than ever. At the same time, assessing the tightness in labour markets is not straightforward, for several reasons. First, these aggregate statistics hide substantial cross-country heterogeneity. Second, and more fundamentally, the natural rate of unemployment is unobservable. Furthermore, tightness in the labour market provides only a partial picture of slack in the economy, as slack can vary across different parts of the economy. It is therefore risky to infer it from just a few economic variables. And for each measure of slack the same issue applies as for slack in the labour market: it cannot be observed directly, because the potential (or “trend”) levels of economic variables are unobservable and time-varying. Accordingly, there are various estimates of the aggregate slack and these estimates differ from one another.[1] Some of them are also subject to substantial ex post revisions. For all of these reasons, we need to be cautious when assessing economic slack and look at many economic indicators to achieve a robust assessment. The wage-inflation pass-through Let us turn to the wage-inflation pass-through. Given the recent growth of wages, it is crucial to understand how this will pass through to inflation. But coming to a robust assessment is not straightforward. Both economic theory and the empirical evidence tell us that this pass-through depends on many different factors. One consideration is that the structure of the economy is not constant over time. Over the past few decades, we have been witnessing gradual changes in the economic environment, many of which can be traced back to the ongoing IT revolution. These changes have important implications for inflation and pass-through, too. One such change is the growth of e-commerce, or, as some call it, the “Amazon effect”. Many commentators argue that increased price transparency when shopping online has contributed to keeping inflation low in advanced economies.[2] Whether the growth of e-commerce makes prices less responsive to wages is more debatable. Research suggests that the algorithmic pricing technologies of online retailers make retail prices more sensitive to aggregate, economy-wide shocks – which would imply that pass-through should eventually occur.[3] However, while the optimistic view is that e-commerce, and the IT revolution more generally, contributes to more competition and economic dynamism, there are also concerns about its more pernicious longer-term effects, such as: rising market concentration, a falling labour share and slower long-term growth. One of the factors behind these negative effects is that IT makes it easier for highly productive “superstar” firms to expand into new markets, generating efficiency gains in the short run, but leading to more concentration in the long run.[4] A more general trend leading in the same direction is the rise of intangible inputs, such as brands, software, technologies and databases. Investment in these types of input is steadily increasing as a share of overall investment, and they are becoming increasingly important for firms’ success.[5] The key feature of intangible inputs is that they can be deployed on a larger scale at almost zero additional cost. In other words, they primarily contribute to firms’ fixed costs. The increase in the role of fixed costs and the diminishing role of variable costs can have important implications for the structure of an industry: these changes contribute to an increase in concentration, a long-term decline in productivity (after an initial surge) and a fall in the labour share.[6] The lesson for our discussion is that the rise of intangibles implies that marginal costs (such as wages) may be playing a decreasing role in price-setting decisions, thereby leading to a lower wage-inflation pass-through. Some theories suggest that the wage-inflation pass-through might also fluctuate depending on the level of inflation.[7] They start from the empirical observation that, at lower levels of inflation, price fluctuations are less persistent. In such an environment, firms are less inclined to match cost increases with price increases. Hence, low inflation leads to lower pass-through and a reduction in the expected persistence of cost and price changes. Turning to the euro area data, we can observe that the recent decoupling of wages and prices is not unprecedented. We have seen a similar decoupling before, in 1999-2000 and in 2005-06. Formal econometric exercises confirm this observation and suggest that the wage-inflation pass-through is state-dependent. One finding is that the pass-through depends on the type of shock hitting the economy: it is stronger for demand shocks, and weaker for supply shocks. [8] Another finding that is particularly relevant now and confirms the theories I have just discussed, is that the pass-through is lower in times of low inflation.[9] Other research has also found that the pass-through is lower in times of economic slack.[10] Conclusion To sum up, the current low unemployment rate and the recent wage increases do not necessarily imply that higher inflation is around the corner. First, measuring economic slack is fraught with well-known difficulties. Second, both theory and empirical studies suggest that the wage-inflation pass-through varies over time and depends on many factors. Arguably, the structural changes under way in advanced economies imply that the pass-through may be on the decline. The bottom line is that monetary policy decisions need to be based on a wide array of economic indicators, not just the unemployment rate and wages. I have touched upon some of the economic effects of the IT revolution. While there might be dangers ahead, I have no doubt that, with appropriate regulation, this revolution will contribute to growth and prosperity in Europe and the world. It will also change the way we work in central banks. We are actively trying to foster this change.

This is the logic behind the Phillips curve, which, in its most common form, relates inflation to a measure of economic slack, expected inflation and supply shocks.[1] The relationship between output and inflation was already under scrutiny well before the pandemic. After the global financial crisis of 2008, inflation didn’t fall nearly as much as had been implied by conventional Phillips curve estimates. And once economies around the world recovered and unemployment fell, the bounce-back in inflation fell short of model predictions. This is why that episode is known as the period of “missing deflation” and “missing inflation”.[2] The situation changed fundamentally in the aftermath of the pandemic, when the relationship between inflation and the output gap proved to be much stronger than what would have been expected based on historical estimates. We observed a noticeably steeper Phillips curve across advanced economies, including the euro area (Slide 2).[3] In my remarks today, I would like to draw lessons from the instability of the Phillips curve over the past 20 years for the optimal conduct of monetary policy. I will argue that the evidence of a re-flattening of the Phillips curve after the long period of high inflation suggests that, in the euro area, the most appropriate policy response to the potential risks to price stability arising from fiscal expansion and protectionism is to keep a steady hand and maintain rates close to where they are today – that is, firmly in neutral territory. Monetary policy and the slope of the Phillips curve The slope of the Phillips curve has first-order implications for the conduct of monetary policy. If the curve is steep, as it appeared to be in recent years, monetary policy is highly effective in reducing inflation, with only a limited impact on growth and employment. The smaller “sacrifice ratio” suggests that central banks should react more forcefully to deviations of inflation from target, even when the economy is hit by a supply shock that pushes inflation up and output down.[4] A steep Phillips curve hence improves the trade-off facing central banks, weakening the case for “looking through”, as forceful policy action minimises the risks of inflation expectations unanchoring and of inflation becoming entrenched.[5] Policy prescriptions differ fundamentally if the Phillips curve is flat. In this case, a large policy impulse is required to move output sufficiently to generate aggregate price effects. It can then be optimal for policy to tolerate moderate deviations of inflation from target, as the cost of closing a small inflation gap relative to the target may exceed the benefits. This prescription holds in both directions. When inflation is above the target, a flat Phillips curve would require a sharp rise in policy rates to bring medium-term inflation down from, say, 2.3% to 2%. Such a course of action may imply a substantial rise in unemployment and may thus not be welfare-improving for society at large – a trade-off central banks may face during the last mile of disinflation.[6] The experience of the 2010s, when inflation was persistently below the target, demonstrates that the argument also holds in the opposite direction. If bringing inflation up from 1.7% to 2%, for example, requires purchasing a large fraction of outstanding government bonds and making potentially time-inconsistent promises about the future path of interest rates, then the central bank must consider carefully whether the benefits outweigh the costs, such as making losses in the future, market dysfunction, rising wealth inequality, financial instability and threats to its reputation.[7] The role of inflation expectations However, the ability to tolerate moderate deviations of inflation from target critically hinges on a firm anchoring of inflation expectations – that is, a low sensitivity of inflation expectations to realised inflation. If inflation expectations are well-anchored, policymakers can tolerate moderate deviations from target, as fluctuations in inflation tend to fade away. If, however, inflation expectations are at risk of unanchoring, central banks should act forcefully.[8] There are two challenges to this strategy. One is that the anchoring of inflation expectations is endogenous. Central banks themselves can cause an unanchoring if inaction in the face of price shocks is perceived as weakening its commitment to securing price stability.[9] History shows that it can be costly to reestablish the credibility of the nominal anchor once it has been lost. This is also because inflation expectations are path-dependent. Research shows that the experience of high inflation may raise the sensitivity of inflation expectations to new inflation surprises.[10] The other challenge is that different measures of inflation expectations often yield different results (Slide 3). As such, robust trends cannot easily be identified in real time, much like the slope of the Phillips curve.[11] Measures of inflation expectations can even point in opposite directions. Research from the early days of the pandemic showed that most consumers expected the pandemic to raise prices, contrary to the views held by professional forecasters at the time.[12] State-dependent pricing and tight labour markets can explain steeper Phillips curve and post-pandemic inflation surge The recent period of high inflation illustrates how sensitive policy conclusions can be to the assessment of the slope of the Phillips curve and to measures of inflation expectations that central banks use in their analysis. Two key theories have been proposed to explain the post-pandemic inflation surge.[13] The first relates to firms’ price-setting behaviour. Standard New Keynesian models assume that the probability of firms resetting their prices is constant over time. This is a fair description of aggregate price movements when inflation is low and aggregate shocks are small (Slide 4). However, the past few years have demonstrated that this “linear” relationship breaks down in the face of large shocks.[14] When marginal costs increase rapidly and threaten to erode profit margins, firms tend to raise their prices more frequently. As a result, the Phillips curve steepens. This feedback loop is strongly asymmetric.[15] It acts as an inflation accelerator when firms face positive demand or adverse cost-push shocks.[16] But it does little to firms’ pricing strategies in the face of disinflationary shocks due to downward price rigidities. This helps explain why inflation did not fall much when the pandemic broke out but increased sharply after the reopening of our economies (Slide 5).[17] The second theory relates to the tightness of the labour market. Downward nominal wage rigidity has been a key factor explaining the “missing deflation” in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.[18] If nominal wages do not fall, or fall only very slowly, firms’ marginal costs change only moderately, and hence disinflationary pressures face a natural lower bound, even if slack is large. But when the labour market is tight, wages are more flexible as firms outbid each other in securing their desired workforce. Benigno and Eggertsson show that this channel led to a non-linear inflation surge in the United States whenever the number of job vacancies exceeded the number of unemployed workers (Slide 6).[19] In the euro area, the threshold was lower, but the curve still exhibited strong signs of non-linearity. Rising near-term inflation expectations may have shifted the Phillips curve up New research for the United States, however, suggests that the evidence in favour of the second theory is not very robust. Specifically, the finding of non-linearity depends critically on which measure is used to control for inflation expectations: non-linearity holds when controlling for expectations of professional forecasters, but it disappears once inflation expectations of households and firms are considered.[20] In other words, it is conceivable that the Phillips curve did not become steeper but rather shifted upwards as inflation expectations rose.[21] Non-linearity has also been rejected recently using a similar approach based on regional data for the euro area.[22] Moreover, the expectations that are relevant for such an upward shift are not necessarily the longer-term expectations that central banks typically pay most attention to. These have remained remarkably stable over the past few years (Slide 7). Rather, inflation expectations over the near term, such as the next 12 months, may be more important in driving macroeconomic outcomes. Bernanke and Blanchard, for example, show that one-year-ahead inflation expectations explain a significant share of the recent marked rise in nominal wages, and hence inflation, in the United States.[23] Similar evidence has been found for the euro area and other advanced economies.[24] Again, there appears to be an asymmetry: the risks that the Phillips curve shifts downwards are substantially lower. Research shows that consumers tend to respond more to inflationary than disinflationary news, as households value increases in their purchasing power and as they pay less attention to inflation when it is low.[25] The impact of tariffs on inflation in the euro area Understanding the reasons behind the recent inflation surge is not only important from a conceptual perspective. It also matters for setting monetary policy today, as we are once again confronted with historically large shocks. For central banks, this is a difficult environment to navigate. Memories of high inflation are still fresh after a long period of sharply rising prices. And just as during the pandemic, there is considerable uncertainty about how firms and households are going to respond to shocks that are largely outside the historical empirical range. Ultimately, the impact of current shocks on prices and wages, and hence the appropriate monetary policy response, will depend on the shape and location of the Phillips curve. Monetary policy should focus on the medium term and underlying inflation Let me illustrate this by looking at the euro area. Given the lags in policy transmission, the relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term. The past few years, however, demonstrated that inflation forecasting at times of large structural shocks is inherently difficult and plagued by large uncertainty. For this reason, the ECB and other central banks have increasingly turned to a data-dependent approach to monetary policy, where the observed dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission are used to cross-check the inflation projections.[26] This approach remains valid today.[27] But data dependence is not in contrast to being forward-looking. In the current situation, the high level of economic uncertainty, together with the sharp fall in energy prices and a stronger euro exchange rate, will likely dampen headline inflation in the short run, potentially pushing it below our 2% target. The question is whether these developments provide meaningful signals about the net impact of current shocks on medium-term inflation. During the pandemic, for example, a strong appreciation of the euro against the US dollar, by nearly 14% over seven months, and a marked decline in energy prices were followed by a historical inflation surge. Data dependency hence requires examining the potential channels through which current shocks could affect underlying inflation over the medium term. In the euro area, there are two main forces that could have the size and persistence to pull underlying inflation sustainably away from our 2% medium-term target. One is fiscal policy, which is set to expand on a scale unseen outside periods of deep economic contraction. Germany has eased its constitutional debt brake for defence-related spending, and has committed to spending €500 billion, or more than 10% of GDP, on infrastructure and the green transition over the next 12 years. In addition, the European Commission has invited Member States to activate the national escape clause to accommodate increased defence expenditure across the EU. The impact of these measures on inflation will depend on how they are implemented, especially their impact on the supply side of the economy. But on balance, the fiscal impulse is likely to put upward pressure on underlying inflation over the medium term. Global fragmentation is the second force that could have a lasting impact on prices and wages. As we speak, the scale and scope of tariffs, the extent of retaliation as well as how financial markets respond to these developments all remain highly uncertain. Ongoing negotiations are a sign that mutually beneficial agreements may still be reached. An ideal outcome – the “zero-for-zero” tariff agreement advocated by the European Commission – could even boost growth and employment on both sides of the Atlantic. However, should these negotiations fail, the euro area will simultaneously face adverse supply and demand shocks, as the EU has announced that it will retaliate against higher tariffs. Similar to the pandemic, assessing the relative strength of these forces is inherently difficult. Overall, however, there are risks that a lasting and meaningful increase in tariffs will reinforce the upward pressure on underlying inflation arising from higher fiscal spending over the medium term. To see this, it is useful to look at the factors driving the macroeconomic propagation of tariffs. Euro area foreign demand may prove resilient, with limited effects on inflation The severity of the negative demand shock will depend on two factors. One is the hit to economic activity in the United States and to global demand from raising tariffs across the board. Under the 2 April tariff rates, the United States will face a supply shock of historic proportions. Inflation is poised to rise, real incomes to fall and unemployment to increase. Retaliatory tariffs would weaken the economy further. So even in the absence of demand reallocation, foreign demand can be expected to decline if there is a broad increase in tariffs. The depth and persistence of this decline will also depend on other policies, such as tax and spending cuts and deregulation. And it will crucially depend on the final outcome of tariff negotiations, which is likely to be far less severe than the 2 April announcement. The second factor affecting the severity of the demand shock relates to the degree of demand reallocation – that is, the elasticity of substitution between foreign and domestic products. This elasticity is highly uncertain and varies across industries, products and countries.[28] However, a robust finding in the literature is that products that are more differentiated tend to be relatively price-inelastic, as they are more difficult to substitute. This has great relevance for the euro area, where the bulk of exports to the United States comprise pharmaceuticals, machinery, vehicles and chemicals. These goods are typically highly differentiated (Slide 8, left-hand side). For instance, the supply of machines for producing semiconductors is basically monopolised by one Dutch company. Similarly, banknotes in the United States are overwhelmingly printed using machinery from a single German manufacturer. These and other machines are not easy to replace in the short run, giving euro area exporters leverage to pass higher costs on to foreign importers and limiting the hit to foreign demand. In addition, trade diversion may benefit euro area exports. Should prohibitive tariffs on Chinese imports remain in place, they will measurably raise the euro area’s price competitiveness in the US market. This can be expected to stimulate demand for euro area goods if there are no alternatives in the United States itself, especially as the number of industries in which both Chinese and euro area firms have comparative advantages has increased measurably over the past two decades (Slide 8, right-hand side).[29] New research corroborates this view.[30] It finds that the euro area stands to win in relative terms from a global trade war, as its net exports to the world will rise rather than fall as global demand is reallocated across the global network, offsetting the hit to domestic consumption.[31] In other words, for as long as tariffs are not prohibitive to trade and the uncertainty paralysing activity fades, aggregate euro area foreign demand may prove relatively resilient under a range of potential tariff outcomes. The recent appreciation of the euro does not refute this view. The euro has gone through two distinct phases since the US presidential election in November last year. It first depreciated in nominal effective terms by 3% until mid-February, before starting to appreciate. So, in net terms, the euro is trading just 2.6% above last year’s average. In addition, as most exports to the United States are invoiced in US dollars, the pass-through of changes in the exchange rate to import prices tends to be moderate – by recent estimates just about one-fifth.[32] And potential losses in price competitiveness in third countries are in part compensated by lower import costs, as euro area exports have, on average, a large import content. This price inelasticity is also reflected in recent surveys, with manufacturing firms reporting an expansion in output for the first time in more than two years (Slide 9). Also, fewer firms are reporting falling export orders. Even if part of these developments may reflect frontloading by firms, it is remarkable how resilient sentiment has remained in the face of the extraordinary increase in economic uncertainty. Supply shock puts upward pressure on inflation, reinforced by global supply chains The downward effects on inflation caused by lower demand are likely to be offset, partly or even fully, by the supply shock hitting the euro area through retaliatory tariffs imposed by the EU and other economies. The strength of this supply shock also depends on two factors. One is the extent to which firms pass higher tariffs on to consumers. In the United States, evidence from the 2018 tariff increase suggests that, in most cases, the pass-through to import prices was de facto complete.[33] At the same time, many firms chose to absorb part of the increase in import prices in their profit margins, thereby limiting the increase in consumer price inflation, at least in the short run.[34] Whether firms will respond similarly to a renewed rise in tariffs in the current environment is uncertain. On the one hand, the recent appreciation of the euro, if persistent, provides some margin for euro area firms to buffer cost increases from retaliatory tariffs. On the other hand, profit margins have already been squeezed by high wage growth and a sluggish economy, and the post-pandemic inflation surge may have lowered the bar for firms to pass higher costs on to consumers. Overall, recent surveys of companies in the United States and the euro area suggest that they plan to gradually pass higher tariffs on to consumers over the coming years.[35] In addition, in order to compensate for the hit to input costs, firms also tend to raise the prices of goods not directly affected by tariffs. There is evidence that retailers broadly adjust price markups even if only a subset of wholesale prices change.[36] The second, and related, factor determining the strength of the supply shock relates to global value chains. Unlike during the wave of protectionism in the 1930s, today the dominant share of international trade, about 70%, reflects multinational firms distributing production across countries and along the value chain to minimise costs. In this process, parts and components often cross borders many times. Prohibitive tariffs between the United States and China are already disrupting supply chains. Shipments of goods are declining, potentially causing future shortages of critical intermediate goods that could reverberate across the world. While current conditions are very different from those seen during the pandemic, when supply chain disruptions were a main factor driving the surge in inflation, the impact of tariffs is likely to be amplified as the increase in firms’ marginal costs propagates through the production network. ECB staff analysis shows that, even if the EU does not retaliate, higher production costs transmitted through global value chains could more than offset the disinflationary pressure coming from lower foreign demand, making tariffs inflationary overall (Slide 10, left-hand side).[37] These effects will become stronger with full retaliation, including intermediate goods. So far, the EU’s retaliatory measures have disproportionately targeted final consumer goods, such as beverages, food and home appliances – precisely to avoid broader cost effects being transmitted through value chains (Slide 10, right-hand side). But if the trade conflict intensifies, the scale of retaliation will widen and increasingly include intermediate goods, as these account for nearly 70% of euro area imports from the United States. In other words, retaliatory tariffs on intermediate goods would constitute a much broader cost-push shock for euro area firms, reminiscent of the post-pandemic supply chain disruptions.[38] It is possible that these effects will be mitigated by China redirecting goods originally destined for the United States towards the euro area and other economies at a discount. In practice, however, this mitigation channel is likely to be contained. India, for example, has already raised temporary tariffs on China to curb a surge in imports. Similarly, the European Commission has repeatedly clarified that it intends to protect euro area firms against dumping prices should imports from China rise significantly in response to the evolving trade conflict with the United States.[39] Policy implications How, then, should the ECB respond to the current shocks? The lessons from the post-pandemic surge in inflation suggest that, from today’s perspective, the appropriate course of action is to keep rates close to where they are today – that is, firmly in neutral territory. A “steady hand” policy provides the best insurance against a wide range of potential outcomes. In other words, it is robust to many contingencies. Specifically, it avoids reacting excessively to volatility in headline inflation at a time when domestic inflation remains sticky and new forces are putting upward pressure on underlying inflation over the medium term. Given lags in policy transmission, an accommodative policy stance could amplify risks to medium-term price stability. This steady hand policy also avoids overreacting to concerns that tariffs may destabilise inflation expectations once again. In recent months, households’ short-term inflation expectations have reversed and started rising again. According to the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey, expectations for inflation one year ahead increased to 2.9% in March from their trough of 2.4% in September 2024 (Slide 11, left-hand side). Qualitative inflation expectations, as measured by the European Commission, even rose to levels last seen in late 2022 (Slide 11, right-hand side). Currently, there are no indications that this rise is persistent, or that inflation expectations are at risk of unanchoring. Hence, we can afford to look through the rise in short-term inflation expectations. This could change if we see clear signs of a strong and front-loaded pass-through of potential tariff increases – something that could bring us back to the steep part of the Phillips curve. So far, however, evidence suggests that firms have notably slowed the frequency with which they revise their prices. A steady hand policy also addresses risks of a more substantial decline in aggregate demand in response to the trade conflict. If tight labour markets were the main culprit for the recent steepening of the Phillips curve, risks of a sharp decline in inflation caused by a rise in unemployment are much more moderate today. The reason for this is that in both the United States and the euro area, the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio has fallen markedly and is now at a level that suggests that labour markets are much more balanced (Slide 12). We are thus likely to be operating close to, or at, the flat part of the Phillips curve where a change in unemployment has only limited effects on underlying inflation, in stark contrast to the high inflation period.[40] We would only need to react more forcefully to the tariff shock if we observed a sharp deterioration in labour market conditions or an unanchoring of inflation expectations to the downside. Both seem unlikely at the current juncture. Despite the number of vacancies declining, the euro area labour market has proven resilient, with unemployment at a record low. And most measures of medium-term inflation expectations remain tilted to the upside, including those of professional forecasters (Slide 13). Conclusion My main message today, and with this I would like to conclude, is therefore simple: now is the time to keep a steady hand. In the current environment of elevated volatility, the ECB needs to remain focused on the medium term. Given long and variable transmission lags, reacting to short-term developments could result in the peak impact of our policy only unfolding when the current disinflationary forces have passed. Over the medium term, risks to euro area inflation are likely tilted to the upside, reflecting both the increase in fiscal spending and the risks of renewed cost-push shocks from tariffs propagating through global value chains. Therefore, from today’s perspective, an accommodative monetary policy stance would be inappropriate, also because recent inflation data suggest that past shocks may unwind more slowly than previously anticipated. By keeping interest rates near their current levels, we can be confident that monetary policy is neither excessively holding back growth and employment, nor stimulating it. We are thus in a good place to evaluate the likely future evolution of the economy and to take action if risks materialise that threaten price stability. Thank you.

Zolotas Lecture at the Bank of Greece,Jean-Claude Trichet,,all_ECB_speeches.csv,"Monetary Policy and Private Expectations. Zolotas Lecture at the Bank of Greece Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBAthens, 25 February 2005. Ladies and Gentlemen, Xenophon Zolotas, long-serving Governor of the Bank of Greece and Prime Minister of his country, once said, with supreme synthesis, that “Political magic has always been anti-economic.” In history, monetary policy has sometimes reverted to magic in an attempt to eschew economic reality. The outcomes of such attempts are well-known and their magic has proven short-lived. A decisive change in direction started, in a large part of the industrial world, 30 years ago as a result of a deeper understanding of the role of expectations in shaping economic behaviour. Today, solid and credible institutions have been put in place in many countries and have earned a respectable reputation of good policy management. Decades of experience accumulated from institutional evolution and advances in economic thinking have provided us with guidelines for designing credible institutions that are based on sound economic principles. Clearly, the open-ended nature of economic progress confronts central banks with new and unprecedented challenges and will no doubt keep central banks occupied in the years to come with the issue of how to maintain expectations of low inflation and preserve credibility. The creation of the Euro is an example of such a challenge. These will be my themes today. Governor and Prime Minister Zolotas was an early advocate of a monetary regime in which the formation of prices is fully protected from the influence of short-term considerations. So, some thoughts on expectations and their subtle interactions with institutions and policies might be an appropriate tribute to his memory. Central banks’ long quest for macroeconomic stability 30 years ago the formation of expectations moved from a peripheral area of theoretical enquiry into the very core of macroeconomic thinking. Today, the economics of expectations and macroeconomics itself are largely coextensive. The trigger of this transformation was, as is well known, the rational expectations revolution, which started with the pioneering work by Robert Lucas (1972, 1973) and Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace (1975).[1] The upshot of the Rational Expectations hypothesis is that – at least in a world in which information is largely publicly available and speedily disseminated – individuals should not make predictable errors when formulating conjectures about their future. This does not imply that individuals will invariably forecast accurately if random movements are inevitable. But guesses about the future must be correct on average if individuals are to remain satisfied with the mechanism by which their anticipations are formulated. When agents diagnose systematic errors, they have an incentive to amend the basis of their forecasts. Expectations are thus the outcome of a decision process and this process responds and adapts to changing circumstances, in particular to possible changes in the behaviour of monetary authorities. Understanding expectations formation as a process underscores the strategic interdependence that exists between expectations formation and economic institutions. Recognition of this interdependence by central bankers and legislators profoundly changed the way in which macroeconomic authorities view the nature of policymaking. Central bankers came to hold the view that monetary policy is not a sequence of isolated policy actions. If agents, when forming their expectations, seek to capture the general pattern of monetary policy, then the relevant problem to solve for central banks centres not only on the size and the timing of a given interest rate move in response to a particular state of the economy, but also and overall it relates to the strategy for repeatedly adjusting the policy instrument in response to the state of the economy, whatever this might be. So, monetary policymakers and, gradually, legislators came to recognise that the meaningful set of choices that societies face relates to alternative monetary policy regimes, that is a clear specification of the central bank objective and of its strategy in managing economic events. The notion that monetary regimes are very powerful in shaping public expectations had received dramatic evidence when the old monetary policy order, the Bretton Woods arrangements, foundered. In those circumstances, private sectors in a large portion of the industrial world were left for years in the dark about the “true” objectives of monetary policy, and about the determination with which central banks were prepared to pursue it. A new monetary order could not be established unless it tackled the problem of the mandate and of the strategy squarely. Building on a time-tested tradition of prudent central banking – which after all had survived in Germany, in Switzerland and in a number of other economies – a number of authors laid out the essence of the mandate problem.[2] It appeared that the anchoring of inflation and inflation expectations is primarily a matter of delegating monetary policy to an independent central bank with one overriding long-term objective: the maintenance of price stability. As the collective reflections progressed, this notion was sharpened to a considerable extent. Throughout the 1990s many central bank charters were stipulated with institutional independence and the primary mandate of monetary stability. The 1998 decision of the ECB Governing Council to characterise its understanding of price stability in quantitative terms can be traced to a shared perception that such stipulations could help focus inflation expectations more tightly. Recent empirical work indeed offers support to that perception. Monetary institutions that have been more explicit in delineating what they mean – in numerical terms – by “price stability” have been more successful in promoting lower inflation and lower output variability.[3] However, an appropriate mandate is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for lasting macroeconomic stability. Important sources of instability in inflation expectations could still arise if the central bank – even one endowed with a clear mandate to preserve price stability – is not sufficiently clear as regards its own monetary policy concept and strategy. The decision taken by the Governing Council of the ECB in October 1998 to spell out the contours of its monetary policy strategy attests to the extent to which the notion of a monetary policy strategy has become operationally meaningful. To secure stability, a central bank has to act forcefully and pre-emptively to nascent signs of inflation or deflation.[4] * * * To be sure, a world in which central banks’ intended policy measures and market views are perfectly aligned is likely to appear only in textbook analysis. However, central banks’ preoccupation with private expectations has established a new climate of mutual understanding with economic agents and the public at large. Central banks have stepped up the number of institutional fora and occasional gatherings at which they document their strategies and carefully explain their actions to broad audiences. In 1998, when designing its mode of communication on monetary policy, the ECB chose to be in the vanguard of this new practice. As a consequence, the leverage of central bank pronouncements and actions over private economic behaviour has considerably strengthened. One of the central banks’ key tasks has become today guiding the markets and stabilising sentiment. These reflections might inspire two questions. The first is: how did the new European monetary regime successfully impose itself in the broad perceptions of the public? And the second is: to which kind of new challenges and new battles should we be prepared? Let me try to respond to these two questions. The transition to Economic and Monetary Union How expectations react to a major change in policy regime is still an issue of contention. 20 years ago, the fathers of the rational expectations revolution espoused an optimistic position: if an institutional change – even an abrupt one – is sufficiently credible, expectations will focus instantly on the new equilibrium. Other scholars are more inclined to think that instant refocusing is unlikely. Agents should be expected to learn gradually about the new regime, and probe and test it with the benefit of time. The extraordinary episode of the convergence towards Economic and Monetary Union in Europe in the second half of the 1990s offers a laboratory case for discriminating between these two hypotheses. The Maastricht Treaty came into force in November 1993. Its fundamental inspiration was the need to ensure that participants in EMU are like-minded in their pursuit of stability in economic and monetary affairs. It vested the European System of Central Banks with a very high degree of independence and safeguarded it against external interference. The new single monetary authority was to be indisputably devoted to one overriding objective, the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. In that respect, the Treaty embodied both the best monetary tradition available in Europe and the essence of the principles that had been distilled through years of academic reflection. In addition, convergence criteria were designed to provide countries with yardsticks against which to measure their progress toward a true culture of stability in the run-up to Monetary Union. But the interpretation of the entry criteria remained a matter of debate for most of the years that followed the promulgation of the Treaty. Observers were divided. Some took the position that the Treaty’s criteria were too strict and ambitious, given the initial conditions from which a number of member countries had to start convergence. Others, from the perspective of the most stable economies in the EU, were convinced that they granted considerable, in fact excessive, latitude. This debate between strictness and latitude left a margin of ambiguity, which largely affected the evolution of expectations prior to 1998. The perception that the criteria might be impossible to meet for countries too far off the benchmarks produced uncertainty over the number of countries able to participate in Monetary Union from the outset. On the other hand, the suspicion that the Maastricht criteria would tolerate a large dispersion of economic performances across countries produced anxiety that Monetary Union – if it were ever to materialise – could mean convergence to the average, rather than the best, standards of macroeconomic discipline. The power of a credible institutional change to bend expectations became evident in late 1996 and 1997. The latter part of 1996 saw a determined drive toward fiscal consolidation in Italy and Spain. This facilitated in those countries a sharp fall in interest rate premia at long maturities and an easing in monetary conditions more generally [see Charts 1d and 1a]. In June 1997, the Stability and Growth Pact was sealed in Amsterdam. It reassured the markets that the adjustment made in public finances in a large portion of the European Union would be lasting and would survive a country’s adoption of the euro. By the first half of 1997 interest rate differentials had been compressed to levels not seen in decades. Uncertainty surrounding the breadth of Monetary Union at its starting date thus quickly disappeared. But a measure of anxiety remained about the standards that would apply in the new economic and monetary entity. This source of anxiety came to the surface in summer 1997, when the intermediate-maturity yields paid by those core countries which had reached complete alignment started to rise in sync [see Chart 1b and 1c]. The balance of market expectations seemed to be shifting toward a loose interpretation of the new regime. A conviction that was gaining ground was that the rapid descent of short-term rates in the converging economies of Italy, Spain and Portugal would be matched by a gradual increase in the short-term rates of the low-yield economies. The two paths would meet somewhere half-way. This instability of market expectations did not go unnoticed in particular in the Central Banks issuing the currencies that had already converged. Signs of an upswing were still tentative and price strains were not yet fully in sight in this core currency area. Nevertheless, in October, pre-emptive action took place to forestall the build-up of an inflationary potential in the delicate phase of transition to monetary union. This interest rate move was a strong sign of determination. The policy message was reinforced through a consistent communication campaign which the Central Banks concerned, together with the European Monetary Institute, launched in the last few months of the year to explain the meaning of their action. The essence of the message was the following. The assumption made by some observers and by part of the market literature, according to which the entry interest rates in the Euro on 1 January 1999 would be some kind of average of the interest rates of the composing currencies was totally wrong. On the contrary, the very construction of the Euro was based on total continuity with the most credible national currencies. The concept of the transition was based upon “benchmarking”, namely convergence towards the best performers and not convergence towards a mean. The modest interest rate increase that took place in a small number of economies was designed exclusively to preserve monetary stability and inflationary expectations for the corresponding currencies which were the benchmark for the Euro. The ECB itself, the soon to be born monetary authority, would be uncompromising in its role as guardian of price stability, in close continuity with its forebears. It was therefore fully justified that interest rate convergence inside the future Euro area would take place progressively on the basis of a merge of the different yield curves of the various currencies with the benchmark yield curve corresponding to the core currencies that had already converged. How did markets react to that action? In particular, what was the impact of the October 1997 interest rate hike on long-term interest rates? Before I answer that question, it could be instructive to reflect on the way markets typically react to an interest rate hike. A shift to a tighter policy raises short-term interest rates. Since longer-term rates are determined in good part as averages of expected future short-term rates, an initial tightening of policy – not to be immediately reversed – should exercise an upward pull on the yields paid by instruments with longer maturities. However, the factors determining long-term rates, notably those at the very long end of the term structure, are mostly associated with the premium to compensate for expected inflation and for the risk that inflation might vary widely over those horizons. Therefore, if the policy tightening is perceived as an effective action to restore or preserve conditions of price stability, then a hike in short-term rates does not necessarily suggest a rise in market rates on instruments with very long maturities. In fact, by soothing concerns about inflation looking far into the future, a policy hike could be reflected in a lower inflation premium and a decline in nominal long bond rates. Indeed, empirical tests find that the sign of the overall response of long rates to a change in policy is not independent of the credibility rating that markets assign to the monetary regime in which they operate. With some simplification, two polar regimes have been identified. On the one side, a full-credibility environment is one in which there is no dispute over the “true” objective of monetary policy and about the central bank’s determination to do all it takes to keep inflation low and steady around that objective. Markets are not inclined to project an observed inflationary shock far into the future, as expectations are well-anchored. So, long-term rates are minimally affected by any inflation shock that might hit the economy in the current period, and by the monetary policy move that authorities might execute in response to it. Presumably, this is a world in which nominal long-term bond rates are most unresponsive to changes in policy. A world in which long bonds are regarded as a conservative type of investment, with stable and dependable real returns. The opposite happens when inflation expectations are not firmly secured. In circumstances of incomplete credibility, an inflationary shock is more likely to be extrapolated far into the future, because inflation itself is more persistent, and because changes in the short-term rate are viewed as less effective in restraining inflationary pressures. In this regime, a policy tightening comes together with expectations of higher and more obstinate inflation in the future. So, long-term nominal yields will tend to move up in the aftermath of an interest rate hike. A third typology is also conceivable: a situation in which markets perceive a shift from one regime to the other. Imagine that market participants were to regard a policy move as a signal dissipating all the ambiguity that might have existed before about the true objectives of monetary policy. Imagine that a single move in a particular situation were to show the foundations of a new regime, and show it to be more likely than the past regime to operate according to the rules of a full-credibility monetary standard. In this situation, one would expect to see an interest rate hike being accompanied by a decline in long-term rates.[5] This brings me back to 1997. The evidence that we gather from that episode is very difficult to rationalise and highly controvertible, especially because the financial crises in Asia and Russia – which took place around the same time – might blur the picture as we look back to those times. Overall, the evidence certainly warrants closer and better scrutiny. But my reading of the episode is that it is consistent with a shift to a more credible policy regime. After the announcement of October 1997 and the communication thereafter market rates reacted in a direction that few could have anticipated. Not only did the remaining spread between the converging economies and the core countries progressively disappear. Thus, the remaining ambiguity about the very nature of the convergence process finally dissipated. But many commentators and market participants – not to mention policymakers – noted that the benchmark yield curve itself was changing shape in a direction that demonstrated an additional clear break in expectations.[6] This is without doubt a remarkable success. Yet, it is not one grounded in magic but based on a sequence of sound institutional, economic and monetary decisions. Securing and reinforcing credibility To sum up my understanding of why we have so impressively succeeded in mastering a smooth transition to the euro, I will mention six necessary conditions that had to be met and were met. Had only one of these conditions not been met, the transition would not have been a success. These conditions are the following: Independence: full guarantee for the independence of the ECB was given by the Treaty and guaranteed by it; Clarity: clear primary objective of price stability given by the Treaty to the new independent institution, the ECB; Continuity: choice by the new institution of an arithmetic definition of price stability in the medium run for the euro area identical to the previous core definition of price stability; Conceptual anchoring: choice by the new institution of the monetary policy concept based on a two pillar approach, with not only an economic pillar, but also a monetary pillar – helping, in particular, to anchor the long term side of the inflation expectations. Transparency: decision to make public, from the very beginning, the arithmetic definition of price stability, the monetary policy strategy that would be applied by the ECB, as well as giving in real time the monthly diagnosis of the Governing Council and the reasons of the decisions taken on interest rates on the occasion of the press conferences following the meeting of the Governing Council; Fiscal consistency: guarantees for sound fiscal policies enshrined in the Treaty in the form of the Maastricht criteria and appropriate implementation of these principles by the Stability and Growth Pact regulations. It is my conviction that each and every of these six conditions were and are necessary. My personal conjecture is that the 6 together have proved to be a sufficient set of conditions to permit the full success of the transition. That being said, it remains absolutely remarkable that the real progress made in reducing inflation expectations in the core currency area in the few months leading up to the final decision over EMU participation in May 1998 was fully preserved at the moment of the transition and afterwards. I would suggest that economic research continue to work actively on the question of the optimality of the transition. After all, the setting up of the euro is historically the most important monetary reform of all times and this transition contains a wealth of information and lessons that have not yet been fully explored. Anchoring solidly inflation expectations at a low level at the birth of the currency was a success. But credibility is never gained once and for all. It has to be permanently preserved and enhanced. That is the reason why for central bankers vigilance is always of the essence. To exert vigilance effectively and efficiently the anchoring and monitoring of inflation expectations, particularly on the long end of the time horizon, are both very important. Let me elaborate a little bit on that. We know that excess volatility of expectations can be signalled by abnormal developments in monetary and credit conditions. This is likely to be the case when unsustainable surges in asset prices – propelled by flights of optimism, and sustained by unanchored expectations – are built on conditions of excess liquidity. The drifting of expectations away from the central bank objective toward chronic inflation or debilitating deflation has historically very often been associated with monetary imbalances foreshadowing and facilitating the process. So, broadening the scope of macroeconomic analysis to include a systematic monitoring of monetary and credit developments can offer a strong failsafe mechanism against the risk that, with inflationary pressures apparently at bay, the central bank might be encouraged to favour or tolerate boom-bust developments of credit and liquidity. The central bank committing to monitoring monetary developments and referring to a given path of long-run monetary growth – compatible with price stability and with steady-state growth for the real economy – has a powerful tool for anchoring long-term inflation expectations. The possibility that these expectations might not find a focal point, or might settle on a point inconsistent with the central-bank declared objective will be minimised.[7] Monitoring a wide range of expectation indicators The ECB also monitors a range of indicators that provide more direct evidence on inflationary expectations in the euro area. It seems obvious that the way private agents form their anticipations will most likely differ in important dimensions across different types of agents. A central bank should thus not rely on a single indicator when monitoring these expectations but rather take a comprehensive and pragmatic approach that balances the information provided by various sources.[8] From this perspective, a single measure of expected inflation – one constructed on the basis of the central bank’s own internal analysis – might be particularly misleading. By their very nature, inflation expectations are not directly observable. However, there exist two main ways to construct measures of inflation expectations. A direct way consists in asking people about their expectations of future inflation. A more indirect way is to extract the information revealed by observable financial data. The ECB makes constant use of both measures. Direct measures of inflation expectations in the euro area are provided by a number of surveys. These are regularly analysed in the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin. One comes from the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters. This is a quarterly survey conducted by the ECB. It asks experts affiliated with financial or non-financial institutions based within the European Union to forecast euro area inflation up to five years ahead. Importantly, survey respondents also provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty surrounding their forecasts in the form of ranges. The dispersion and asymmetry around the mean provide useful information about shifts in inflation expectations that might be in the pipeline. Another measure of inflation expectations is provided by the survey conducted by Consensus Economics, a private firm. It asks private sector economists to give their short-term and long-term inflation expectations. A further source of information is the European Commission’s monthly Business and Consumer Survey. It asks a large number of manufacturing firms about their selling price expectations and consumers about their inflation expectations. This survey has some limitations however. It provides qualitative information only.[9] In addition, it is available only for a very short time period ahead (12 months). Despite these limitations, detected changes in the direction towards which firms’ and consumers’ expectations are heading may provide useful information. The information that we gather from these diverse sources at present is consistent with a picture of stability. The mean point estimate for HICP inflation indicated by the respondents to the ECB survey in the 4th quarter of 2004 is close to and below 2%, in line with the ECB’s quantitative definition of price stability. This holds true for the expectations relating to the years 2005 and 2006, but also for the five-year period up to 2009. The uncertainty surrounding these forecasts is fairly small, implying that survey respondents assign only small probability to inflation outcomes outside the main scenario. It has to be taken into account that a number of these measures – particularly those stemming from the “break-even” inflation rates extracted from the indexed bonds – remain imperfect indicators of inflation expectations, as several premia, most importantly an “inflation risk premium” but also a “liquidity premium,” are potentially embodied in their calculation. Changes in break-even inflation rates over time could therefore reflect changes in the level of expected inflation, changes in perceived uncertainty about future inflation, changes in the perception of the liquidity risk, or a combination of the three. In addition, their information content could be temporarily distorted by technical market or institutional factors and should therefore be interpreted with caution. During the first half of 2004 break-even inflation rates for the euro area displayed a slight upward movement, unlike the survey evidence reviewed before. In recent months this movement has been partially reversed. While the different behaviour of break-even inflation rates and survey expectations may reflect a time variation in the risk premium contained in nominal bond yields, due for instance to uncertainties associated with the recent increases in energy price, these recent developments have not gone unnoticed at the ECB.[10] Whether the movements in the break-even inflation rates, which are fairly small in absolute terms, reflect or not underlying changes of various risks premia is not yet clear. We are looking at it very carefully. Concluding remarks A renewed fellowship between the academic community, the markets and central banks – so uncharacteristic if viewed from the angle of the dissonances of the ancient past – has been beneficial to the design of appropriate institutions and monetary strategies that allow central banks to effectively deliver the results society ultimately needs: stability and predictability in monetary matters. What matters most is that inflation, thanks to these conceptual advances, has become a mean-reverting process, making occasional deviations from price stability a temporary event. We are living in a world where the possibility of solidly anchoring long term inflation expectations and eliminating the correlation between these long-term inflation expectations and actual inflation has become reality. The ECB and the Eurosystem are proud to have been at the forefront of these advances. Not only have they fully preserved the solid anchoring of inflation expectations all along the past six years, but they have proved that it was possible to ship to the new currency, from day one of its existence, the best anchoring that was available in Europe, which was a major contribution for sustainable growth and job creation. I am fully conscious of the exceptionally high level of confidence and trust the private sector is bestowing on us. This trust is well placed. Economic agents, market participants and our fellow citizens of Europe can be assured that we are determined to remain worth it in all the years to come. Charts Chart 1.

[5] That the response of long-term rates to a change in policy depends on the credibility of the monetary policy regime is conjectured in Marvin Goodfriend (1998), “Using the term structure of interest rates for monetary policy”, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly, Vol. 84/3. Empirical confirmation of that conjecture is provided in Jagjit Chadha and Joe Ganley (1998), “Monetary policy, inflation persistence and the term structure of interest rates: Estimates for the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States” in Ignazio Angeloni and Riccardo Rovelli (eds.), “Monetary policy and the term structure of interest rates”, London: McMillan. Further support is found in Tore Ellingsen and Ulf Söderström (2001), “Monetary policy and market interest rates”, American Economic Review, Vol. 91(5), pp. 1594-1607. [6] One possible interpretation is that markets were growing more convinced that the new regime would embody an even larger amount of credibility than they had attributed to the national central banks with the best monetary record in Europe. In this respect, it should also be noted that in January 1997 the Deutsche Bundesbank had revised its “price norm,” i.e. the “unavoidable inflation rate” that was used for the calculation of the monetary target, from 2% to a range between 1½ and 2%, whilst the Banque de France, for instance, was referring to less than 2 per cent as its definition of price stability. It is a remarkable achievement that the definition of price stability as “less than 2 per cent” was shipped intact to the whole union. This remarkable transition might have been helped by the fact that international financial markets were internalising the dawn of a new era of low inflation and high credibility across a wide range of industrial countries in precisely that very same period. This interpretation receives some support from the fact that US long-term bond rates and the implied forward short-term rates were declining as well.

The Bank of England was established during the sovereign debt crisis of 1690, when the government was unable to obtain funding in the market. The Federal Reserve was created after a series of panics that had rocked the US banking system in the late 19th and early 20th century. The euro was introduced 20 years ago in response to repeated episodes of exchange-rate instability and the need to secure the Single Market against competitive devaluations. The ECB was established as the keystone of the new Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first decade of the Monetary Union was characterised by calm macroeconomic conditions, with limited volatility and steady economic growth. The second decade, however, has seen profound shifts in the prevailing environment – including both financial and sovereign debt crises – and our monetary policy strategy has had to adapt with it. I would like to discuss this morning why this evolution came about and how it was achieved – and what the past twenty years can tell us about the ECB’s monetary policy in the future. Monetary policy before the crisis The ECB’s mandate is given by the Treaty as price stability. In 1998, the Governing Council defined price stability as inflation within a range of 0-2% over the medium term, which constitutes the ECB’s objective. Then, in 2003, the Governing Council clarified that, within this range, it would aim at a focal point of below, but close to, 2%, which remains our medium-term aim to this day. This was a formulation that differed from the standard inflation-targeting framework of the time, which was typically based around a point target for inflation. But there were sound reasons why this definition was put in place. In common with central banks across the world, the ECB faced a macroeconomic environment before the crisis that was predominantly defined by low volatility and moderate shocks, with the distribution of shocks to inflation almost exclusively to the upside. In the euro area, HICP energy prices rose by 80% between January 1999 and September 2008. Under these conditions, establishing a strong reaction function against high inflation was seen as crucial to anchor inflation expectations. Emphasising an aim of “below, but close to, 2%” was seen to imply a stronger commitment than a standard inflation-targeting regime. But monetary policy in the euro area also faced a special challenge. The ECB was a new central bank operating in a very heterogeneous monetary union, which created a particular imperative to establish inflation credibility. Establishing a commitment to controlling inflation was seen as critical to cement lower inflation expectations across the euro area – especially as moderate inflation was a relatively new phenomenon in several Member States. Over the two decades up to 1999, inflation had averaged above 3% in 10 of the 12 original members. The decline in inflation in many countries in the run-up to EMU was in large part due to expectations of joining, as well as to a number of extraordinary actions taken by national authorities to meet the convergence criteria. From 1989-99, long-term inflation expectations had fallen from a range of between 2.5-4.5% in the four largest euro area economies to below 2% across the board. It was now the task of the new central bank to lock in this moderate-inflation environment – and it did so successfully. Over the next decade, inflation expectations internalised the ECB’s commitment to keep inflation down and remained below 2%. But this process of building inflation credibility had implications for the ECB’s reaction function. As a matter of accounting, stabilising headline inflation largely caused by its volatile components must mean that core inflation adjusts downwards. Rolling cross-correlations between energy inflation and core inflation show that an episode of high energy inflation between 1999 and 2007 was accompanied by a period of rapidly softening core inflation.[1] As a result, between January 1999 and September 2008 headline inflation in the euro area averaged 2.35%, while core inflation averaged 1.7% and exceeded 2% less than 15% of the time. Central banks in other advanced economies faced similar challenges and adopted similar strategies. But differences in mandates – and length of track records in fighting inflation – led to differences in how much energy price pass-through to headline inflation others were comfortable accommodating. For example, energy prices in the US CPI rose by 160% over the same period[2] and headline inflation averaged 2.9%. The Federal Reserve reacted less to headline inflation, and core CPI inflation averaged 2.2%.[3] The upshot was that the euro area entered the crisis having succeeded in establishing its anti-inflation credentials, but with underlying inflation dynamics that were perhaps relatively weaker. This was not immediately apparent, as inflation stayed at fairly elevated levels for more than four years after the Lehman crash. Monetary policy responded decisively to the global financial crisis and disinflationary threats seemed to pass quickly. But in hindsight it seems reasonable to conclude that the inflation process was vulnerable to a shift in the environment – which is what transpired from around mid-2012 onwards. New challenges for monetary policy At this point, headline inflation in the euro area began what was, in retrospect, a prolonged downward drift, and core inflation fell by almost a percentage point from mid-2012 to early 2014. There are two factors that help explain the switch to a disinflationary trend. First, the distribution of shocks to inflation moved strongly to the downside and the amplitude of the shocks increased. Supply-side shocks gradually dissipated over the years following the Lehman crash and the sovereign debt crisis. Negative demand shocks, driven at different times by domestic demand and external demand, instead became the dominant source of macroeconomic fluctuations in the euro area. ECB analysis shows that negative demand shocks have weighed on euro-area inflation by more than 1 percentage point on average since the start of the crisis. In the previous ten years, their effect was neutral overall, with periods of both upward and downward pressure.[4] The second factor was a change in the macroeconomic policy mix. While in the first phase of the crisis fiscal and monetary policy had eased in tandem – with fiscal policy loosening by a total of about 3% of potential GDP between 2008 and 2010[5] – thereafter the stance of monetary and fiscal policy decoupled. The euro area fiscal stance turned contractionary in response to the sovereign debt crisis, tightening by around 4 percentage points of potential GDP until 2013 – years the euro area was mostly in recession. This stands in contrast to the United States, where fiscal policy eased more in the initial phase of the crisis, by about 6.5% of potential GDP in total over 2008-09, and then tightened by about 5.5% of potential GDP from 2011 to 2013 when the economic recovery was underway. The euro area was forced onto a different path by the need in some countries to re-establish fiscal credibility. But on aggregate the euro area did not have less fiscal space than the United States: public debt levels were similar in the two jurisdictions. The key difference was that fiscal stabilisation in the United States took place at the federal level, while the euro area lacked a central fiscal instrument to act counter-cyclically. The policy mix is also relevant when it comes to financial sector policies. After the crisis, it was inevitable that banking sectors in advanced economies would have to deleverage, both to cover losses and to re-focus their business models. The United States ensured that this process happened quickly and early. Around 500 failing banks were resolved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, while struggling banks were stress-tested and recapitalised through the Troubled Assets Relief Program. Between 2008 and 2011, US banks improved their leverage ratio[6] by 1.6 percentage points from 7.2 to 8.8%. The response in the euro area was more sluggish. Despite being more levered than their US peers before the crisis, euro area banks improved their leverage ratio by just 0.9 percentage points, from 3.7 to 4.6%, and this was achieved more through shedding assets and less through raising capital.[7] This in part reflected the fact that, due to the fiscal rules, public support for banks was concentrated in countries with fiscal space. Moreover, without a common resolution framework only around 50 banks were resolved in the euro area in this period.[8] So a weak banking sector continued to drag on the euro area economy, which was especially pernicious given the importance of the banking lending channel for financing. In sum, the ECB faced an environment where there was both an increasing need to counter demand shocks, and an increasing burden on monetary policy to do so. Our strategy therefore had to adapt to these new circumstances in order to continue delivering our aim. Monetary policy responded first in the summer of 2012 by acting to defuse the sovereign debt crisis, which had evolved from a tail risk for inflation into a material threat to price stability. Announcing Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) established our commitment to counter unwarranted redenomination risks in sovereign debt markets and acted as a powerful circuit breaker. While OMT was never activated, the effect of its announcement was equivalent to that of a large-scale asset purchase programme: spreads in vulnerable countries fell on average by more than 400 basis points over the next two years. The macroeconomic impact of OMT was also analogous to other purchase programmes: ECB research finds that the GDP and price effects of OMT were broadly in line with those estimated for the QE that took place in the United States and the United Kingdom.[9] But the lingering effects of the sovereign debt crisis dented the capacity of this stimulus to counter the new disinflationary trend. The delayed bank deleveraging process in the euro area began to accelerate, with banks further shrinking their balance sheets and paying back central bank loans. Bank balance sheets declined by around 20 percentage points of GDP in 2013 alone and, at the end of 2013, credit growth to the private sector was contracting at a rate of 2.4% relative to a year earlier. On the demand side, risk appetite in the private sector collapsed, with investment subtracting 1.6 percentage points from GDP growth in 2012. The ECB therefore reacted again in 2013 by cutting its main refinancing rate twice, from 0.75% to 0.25%, and by seizing the opportunity of the launch of European banking supervision. We carried out a comprehensive assessment of bank balance sheets, with the aim of steering the process of balance sheet repair towards a positive macroeconomic outcome. Banks strengthened their balance sheets by over €200 billion in advance of the outcome.[10] That put the banking sector in a much stronger position to transmit our policy. But at this point, the euro area economy was hit by a further downward shock to inflation in the form of a 60% collapse in oil prices in mid-2014, which pushed inflation into negative territory. With underlying inflation already weakening, inflation expectations began to be affected. As the scope for further interest rate cuts was now limited, it became increasingly clear that our reaction function needed to evolve to address these new challenges. Indeed, since our policy framework had never been systematically tested by persistent disinflationary risks, the ECB had not yet had a chance to demonstrate its intolerance for inflation remaining below its aim for protracted periods of time. At the same time, there appeared to be some uncertainty about which tools we would be able to deploy if the effective lower bound were reached. Unlike in other major economies, the ECB had not resorted to large-scale asset purchases during the global financial crisis and its aftermath. Some even questioned the legality of asset purchases in Europe and their effectiveness in our bank-based economy. If these uncertainties were not removed, there was a material risk that falling inflation could become self-fulfilling: the public could begin expecting a smaller monetary policy response to future inflation undershoots, and revise their inflation expectations further downwards. In other words, credibility now relied not just on perceptions of the ECB’s commitment to our aim, but also on perceptions of our capability to fight low inflation. We responded to the situation in three main ways. The ECB’s policy response The first was by clarifying the symmetry of our aim. While the quantitative definition of price stability was instrumental in establishing credibility in the first decade, its asymmetric formulation may have led to misperceptions in a low-inflation environment. Thus we made clear that our policy aim was fully symmetric,[11] and it was symmetric around the level that we had established in 2003: below, but close to, 2%. It is achieving this aim over the medium term that steers our policy decisions. In addition, we clarified that symmetry meant not only that we would not accept persistently low inflation, but also that there was no cap on inflation at 2%. As I emphasised on a number of occasions,[12] our medium-term orientation implies that inflation can deviate from our aim in both directions, so long as the path of inflation converges back towards that focal point over the medium-term policy horizon. The second part of our response was to lay out the tools we would use to counteract downside inflation risks, which began with a speech I gave in Amsterdam in April 2014 that described three contingencies and the instruments we would use to react to them. This established unambiguously that we had no taboos about resorting to unconventional measures.[13] There was nothing institutionally or legally special about the euro area that prohibited monetary policy from adding accommodation once the lower bound was approached. Third, as these various contingencies played out, we operationalised our reaction function by launching a series of new instruments. We broke through the zero bound by lowering our deposit rate into negative territory, launched our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) to provide incentives for banks to lend, and implemented a large-scale asset purchase programme (APP) of public and private securities. These measures were deliberately designed to work as a package and ease the stance through complementary channels, working both through banks and the wider matrix of capital markets. The negative rate policy challenged market expectations that when rates reached zero they could only go up and not down, which helped skew the distribution of rate expectations and depress the short end of the risk-free curve – a key benchmark for the pricing of bank loans. Asset purchases in tandem compressed yields at the longer end of the curve, pushing down mortgage rates and, at the same time, making bank lending to firms more attractive in risk-adjusted terms. And bank-based transmission was amplified by the TLTROs, which lowered funding costs and increased competition among banks. Over time, we also enhanced this framework with state- and date-based forward guidance[14], allowing us to rotate the marginal tool for determining the policy stance from asset purchases to forward guidance as the economic outlook improved. Today, this forward guidance links our expectations on the path of future rates to the path of inflation towards our aim, leading to automatic easing if the convergence path towards 2% is delayed. There is mounting evidence that these instruments have been effective.[15] Negative rates have proven to be a very important tool in the euro area – and more so than they would have been in an economy like the United States. Indeed, the Federal Reserve eschewed negative rates in part due to concerns about their effects on the money market industry, which are key intermediaries in the US financial system. But this factor is less relevant in the euro area, since many money market funds have been operating as Variable Net Asset Value funds, and therefore are more flexible to extend duration to seek additional returns. Furthermore, the euro area is a relatively open economy for its size, with total trade making up 51% of GDP,[16] compared with 27% in the United States. This means that the impact of negative rates on inflation and financing conditions via the exchange rate is more powerful. In short, faced with a new environment of downside risks and limited conventional policy space, the ECB showed that it had no shortage of tools available to respond. Unconventional measures proved suitable substitutes for conventional ones: using market prices to construct a so-called “shadow short rate”,[17] the stimulus provided appears broadly in line with the recommendation of monetary policy rules as suggested by recent academic research.[18] Our capacity to react in this way was made possible by the flexibility embedded in our mandate – a flexibility that was confirmed by the recent ruling of the European Court of Justice. This not only affirmed that asset purchases are a legal instrument of monetary policy in the euro area, but emphasised the broad discretion of the ECB in using all our tools in a necessary and proportionate way to achieve our objective. However, although we have seen the successful transmission of monetary policy to financing conditions, and from financing conditions to GDP and employment, the final legs of the transmission process to wages and inflation have been slower than we expected. Wage growth is now strengthening as slack in the labour market diminishes. But the pass-through from wages to prices remains weak. This may reflect structural changes, such as globalisation and digitalisation, which mostly have an impact at this point in the pricing chain. Lingering cyclical weakness can also delay wage-price pass-through as firms elect to squeeze margins rather than raise prices and risk losing market share.[19] Current challenges for monetary policy In this environment, what matters is that monetary policy remains committed to its objective and does not resign itself to too-low inflation. And, as I emphasised at our last monetary policy meeting, we are committed, and are not resigned to having a low rate of inflation forever or even for now. We have described the overall orientation of our monetary policy as being “patient, persistent and prudent”. Patient, because faced with repeated negative shocks we have had to extend the policy horizon. Persistent, because monetary policy will remain sufficiently accommodative to ensure the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim. And prudent, because we will pay close attention to underlying inflation dynamics and to risks and will adjust policy appropriately. This orientation is expressed in our current policy framework, which allows us to adapt our forward guidance and react flexibly as the macroeconomic situation evolves. That was illustrated by the monetary policy decisions taken at our meeting earlier in June. Looking forward, the risk outlook remains tilted to the downside, and indicators for the coming quarters point to lingering softness. The risks that have been prominent throughout the past year, in particular geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets have not dissipated. The prolongation of risks has weighed on exports and in particular on manufacturing. In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required. In our recent deliberations, the members of the Governing Council expressed their conviction in pursuing our aim of inflation close to 2% in a symmetric fashion. Just as our policy framework has evolved in the past to counter new challenges, so it can again. In the coming weeks, the Governing Council will deliberate how our instruments can be adapted commensurate to the severity of the risk to price stability. We remain able to enhance our forward guidance by adjusting its bias and its conditionality to account for variations in the adjustment path of inflation. This applies to all instruments of our monetary policy stance. Further cuts in policy interest rates and mitigating measures to contain any side effects remain part of our tools. And the APP still has considerable headroom. Moreover, the Treaty requires that our actions are both necessary and proportionate to fulfil our mandate and achieve our objective, which implies that the limits we establish on our tools are specific to the contingencies we face. If the crisis has shown anything, it is that we will use all the flexibility within our mandate to fulfil our mandate – and we will do so again to answer any challenges to price stability in the future. All these options were raised and discussed at our last meeting. What matters for our policy calibration is our medium-term policy aim: an inflation rate below, but close to, 2%. That aim is symmetric, which means that, if we are to deliver that value of inflation in the medium term, inflation has to be above that level at some time in the future. But fiscal policy should play its role. Over the last 10 years, the burden of macroeconomic adjustment has fallen disproportionately on monetary policy. We have even seen instances where fiscal policy has been pro-cyclical and countered the monetary stimulus. If the unbalanced macroeconomic policy-mix in the euro area in part explains the slide into disinflation, so a better policy mix can help bring it to a close. Monetary policy can always achieve its objective alone, but especially in Europe where public sectors are large, it can do so faster and with fewer side effects if fiscal policies are aligned with it. Recreating fiscal space by raising potential output through reforms and public investment, and respecting the European fiscal framework will maintain investor confidence in countries with high public debt, low growth and low fiscal space. But as fiscal expansion in the other countries may have limited spillovers, national fiscal policies remain constrained. So work on a common fiscal stabilisation instrument of adequate size and design should proceed with broader scope and renewed determination. Conclusion Let me conclude. The euro was introduced twenty years ago in order to insulate the Single Market from exchange-rate crises and competitive devaluations that would threaten the sustainability of open markets. It was also a political project that, relying on the success of the Single Market, would lead to the greater integration of its Member States. On both counts, the vision of our forefathers has scored relatively well. Imagine where the Single Market would be today, after the global financial crisis and rising protectionism, had all countries in Europe been free to adjust their exchange rates. Instead, our economies integrated, converged and coped with the most severe challenge since the Great Depression. That leads me to four observations. First, the integration of our economies and with it the convergence of our Member States has also greatly increased. Misalignments of real effective exchange rates between euro area countries are about a half those between advanced economies with flexible exchange-rates or countries linked by pegged exchange rates and they have fallen by around 20% in the second decade of EMU relative to the first.[20] Second, the dispersion of growth rates across euro area countries, having fallen considerably since 1999, is since 2014 comparable to the dispersion across US states. Third, this has been driven in large part by the deepening of European value chains, with EMU countries now significantly more integrated with each other than the United States or China are with the rest of the world.[21] Most EMU countries export more with each other than with the US, China or Russia. Fourth, employment in the euro area has reached record highs and in all euro area countries but one stands above its 1999 level. But the remaining institutional weaknesses of our monetary union cannot be ignored at the cost of seriously damaging what has been achieved. Logic would suggest that the more integrated our economies become, the faster should be the completion of banking union and capital markets union, and the faster the transition from a rules-based system for fiscal policies to an institution-based fiscal capacity. The journey towards greater integration that our citizens and firms started twenty years ago has been long, far from finished, and with broad but uneven success. But overall, it has strengthened the conviction of our peoples that it is only through more Europe that the implications of this integration can be managed. For some, that trust may lie in a genuine faith in our common destiny, for others it comes from the appreciation of the greater prosperity so far achieved, for yet others that trust may be forced by the increased and unavoidable closeness of our countries. Be that as it may, that trust it is now the bedrock upon which our leaders can and will build the next steps of our EMU. [1]Rostagno et al. (2019), forthcoming. [2]The difference in growth in energy prices between the euro area and the United States can in large part be attributed to differences in tax rates, which are typically higher in the euro area. As such, the share of the final price paid by consumers accounted for by oil is much smaller in the euro area, and CPI energy prices are less affected in aggregate by movements in oil prices. That being said, the energy component has a higher weight in euro area HICP, so a 1 percentage point increase in CPI energy prices has a greater impact on headline inflation in the euro area than in the United States.

But it is still projected to remain too high for too long. In our latest projections, Eurosystem staff expect headline inflation to average 5.4% in 2023, 3.0% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. Staff have also revised up their projections for core inflation, which they now see reaching 5.1% in 2023, before it declines to 3.0% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025. This revision is due to past upward surprises in inflation and the implications of the robust labour market for the speed of disinflation. Specifically, we expect both wages and employment to continue growing strongly over the projection horizon, while output growth will be weaker this year and next. In this context, labour productivity growth will be lower and rising unit labour costs are likely to put upward pressure on inflation. This assessment of price pressures is also confirmed by real-time indicators of underlying inflation. Exclusion measures and indicators that capture the persistent effects of energy are showing signs of softening. But the wage-sensitive components of core inflation remain strong and domestic inflation is rising. This configuration suggests that the external drivers of underlying inflation – namely rising energy costs and supply bottlenecks – are easing, but domestic factors – i.e. wage pressures – are becoming increasingly important. At the same time, our monetary policy is working to rein in inflation pressures. We have already undertaken a sizeable policy adjustment, and this is now starting to be felt along the transmission chain. First, we are seeing our past rate increases being transmitted forcefully to financing conditions. Borrowing costs have increased steeply and growth in loans is slowing. In April, lending rates reached their highest level in more than a decade, standing at 4.4% for business loans and 3.4% for mortgages. Second, our monetary policy is also starting to be transmitted to the demand components that are typically more sensitive to interest rate changes: housing and business investment, as well as durable consumption goods. This is one reason why we are seeing a pronounced divergence between weakening manufacturing and resilient services. The strengthening transmission of policy tightening to the economy helps explain why inflation is projected to decline further towards our target, since it will increasingly dampen demand. Taking into account our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission, the Governing Council decided yesterday to raise interest rates again by 25 basis points. That means we have now raised rates by 400 basis points in less than a year. This is testament to our determination to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. We also confirmed that our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. In other words, we still have ground to cover. Barring a material change to our baseline, it is very likely that we will continue to increase rates at our next policy meeting in July. Thereafter, we will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council also confirmed that it will discontinue the reinvestments under the asset purchase programme as of July 2023.",0.0402239176969736,3.45087871672209,3.55816986705435,hawkish
